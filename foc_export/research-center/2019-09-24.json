I am not much of a planner\/organizer, but if someone(s) want to take the lead, I know all the great coffee, research and travel spots in Oahu so I'll volunteer the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Entrepreneur's Sandbox as host venue...They are in the center of the technology renaissance in Oahu and also right on the water...My lab could be a sponsor as well..",
