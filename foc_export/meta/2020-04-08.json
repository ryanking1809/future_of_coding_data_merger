(Disclaimer: I am part of the Riot core team.) There are many other clients (<https:\/\/matrix.org\/clients\/>) as well for different platforms and UI styles, including terminal-based for those who prefer an old-school IRC-like experience.\n\nTo use a Matrix client, you will need an account on a Matrix server. It's a federated system, so you can create an account on any server. Riot will guide you through creating an account if needed. The <http:\/\/matrix.org|matrix.org> server is free and open to the public, but you can also self-host your own server or use someone else's if they have open registration.\n\nSome day (soon I hope) there will be a matrix:\/\/ URL scheme, but for now there's <https:\/\/matrix.to\/#\/#_slack_futureofcoding_general:matrix.org>, which shows an interstitial page explaining how to reach a given room in several popular clients. It might be good to linkify the aliases on the community page to point there.",
