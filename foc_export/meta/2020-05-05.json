I know people here (and in other Slack communities) highly value people taking their replies into a thread, and since that doesn't work when replying from Matrix, the bridging could become a nuisance. If it reaches that point, do let me know and I can tear down the bridging. Anyway, once there is a native Matrix concept of threads, the Slack bridge would be updated to understand them properly and this issue would go away.",

I know people here (and in other Slack communities) highly value people taking their replies into a thread, and since that doesn't work when replying from Matrix, the bridging could become a nuisance. If it reaches that point, do let me know and I can tear down the bridging. Anyway, once there is a native Matrix concept of threads, the Slack bridge would be updated to understand them properly and this issue would go away."
