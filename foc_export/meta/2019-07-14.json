        "text": "Today I made a change in our program related to its fonts and my colleague wanted to check how it looks like on old versions of macOS. We checked on macOS 10.8 and the program crashed. The released version (<https:\/\/www.soundradix.com\/products\/auto-align-post\/>) does work fine on macOS 10.8 so I started bisecting. The slowest part of the bisect iterations was copying the executable to the machine running an old OS over wifi, causing the bisect process to take most of the day. So I did multi-task myself by participating in online discussions during that off-time. The bisect pointed that the problem came from updating the version of our dependency JUCE. JUCE is a commercial open-source library. This means that we pay them money to use it in commercial products, and also that they don’t like getting contributions and bug fixes because they need to implement everything by themselves to retain their rights to their code, that’s why we have our own bug-fix branch of JUCE (<https:\/\/github.com\/soundradix\/JUCE\/tree\/juce5>). Sadly, `git bisect` works very poorly when code has branches (wasn’t the point of git to support branching?), so my submodule bisection works as follows: when git bisect gets me to a commit, I merge the good commit to it, then test the product, then reset to before the merge to mark `git bisect` `good` or `bad`. At the end I found the problem. The JUCE maintainers fixed Xcode’s deprecation warnings. Apple’s deprecation warnings and developer documentations often include traps. I don’t know if that’s intentional or not but it means that developing code that will work on older versions of their OSs is hard (btw professionals in media do tend to keep using older OSs because they often have expensive audio and video cards and accelerators which don’t always work well with the latest OS)",
