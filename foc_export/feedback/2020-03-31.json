I'll share what I can get from the top of my head.\n\nSome of what I am writing here I have shared in my presentation: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8UH3DjvxDE&amp;t=37s>\n\nSome general principles:\n\n1. Too much expressiveness is bad -- turns programming into Chaos (like Lisp macro hell). Too much restriction is also bad -- turns programming into a prison of Order (try to do complicated IO in Haskell). To get comfortable PL we need to walk a fine line between these Order and Chaos, to balance PL design. Many design decisions that I make just shift balance of Order and Chaos to make users less overwhelmed.\n2. Programmers develop software through observe-modify-repeat loop in their heads. To make programming easy and efficient we need to optimize this loop. Make observation of the change fast, make modification safe and painless.\nSome technical ideas:\n\n1. Actors with isolated memory and communication by copying messages (from Erlang) -- brilliant idea that makes programming a lot easier. When it is guaranteed that this piece of code is influenced by these several inputs it is a lot easier to debug and reproduce it. This is absolutely necessary and should be as widespread as use of pure functions.\n2. Application is basically a composition of many actors that message each other. During execution some actors might be spawned and killed as needed. This is very powerful and possible compositions might be quite overwhelming. To shift this situation towards Order I want to restrict possible compositions: it should be a regular tree.\n3. One powerful data structure for almost everything: DAG. Pattern matching helps a lot with all kinds of manipulation. If an actor provides an interface of a DAG, it should be possible to pattern match against it. This way you can walk database, filesystem or web service in similar manner you would walk local DAG. \n4. Test cases of input and expected output are attached directly to the function, it is part of the annotation. This makes it very easy to modify it -- tests for this particular function would run over and over. Precondition and postcondition code is part of the function. They help to distinguish bad input and error in the code, which helps to make IDE convenient. This feature is a lot easier to implement for structure-based source code.",
