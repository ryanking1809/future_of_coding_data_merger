Inertia being the most powerful force in the universe, the real competitors are not so much other language projects, but the entrenched languages and their many supporters. Language designers are a prickly bunch because they all fall in love with the creations which are like a baby. I have a general purpose language project Beads which is a fusion of a declarative\/deductive type of language bundled with a graphical\/event model and a graph database.\n\nOne of things i have been building are specifications and working examples for a series of reference programs so that potential users can better evaluate which language they want to invest their time learning in detail. We only have so many hours to spend learning new tools vs. using the tools, and one of the things that makes it so hard is that the exact same program is not often implemented across multiple languages. The TodoMVC app for example is one of the worst examples possible, because it relies on text entry fields as the primary data being manipulated, and the text entry field is really the domain of the operating system, as there are at a  million lines of code underlying text input with all the tricky aspects of font rendering, input method control, etc. The reason modern graphical operating systems are so few in number is that when you say \"i would like to have Asian language support\", that blows up into a monster project. The majority of people on this earth don't use the Roman alphabet, and just Japanese by itself is mind-bogglingly difficult to handle. So i am concentrating on things like a clock, wristwatch, tic-tac-toe, snake, chess, and will be adding some engineering and finance examples. If you can't make a stock portfolio report easily your language will never make it in finance for example.",
