Not sure if it would make sense, but I see potential maybe to collaborate it, possibly. We are working on a new dataflow language currently called Flow (may change that name due to lots of overloading of the word Flow in the programming language space) which can be written by hand and executed on the command line (version 14, anyway) or everything done visually using our web app Ohayo. When I see your app, I think \"perhaps we could improve Flow so that it could be under the hood of your app, as well, and perhaps save you some time implementing certain things, while giving our users another totally different UI to do their data science tasks.\" but even if that isn't a direction we go down, maybe I have some information and experience in the space that could be helpful to you. you can also see a list of links to related products in our readme: <https:\/\/github.com\/treenotation\/ohayo>",
