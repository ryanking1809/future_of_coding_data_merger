When you write new code in a function or HTTP\/event handler, we send a diff of the Abstract Syntax Tree (the representation of your code that our editor and servers use under the hood) to our servers, and then we run that code when requests come in. So deployment is just a small write to a database, which is instant and atomic. Our deploys are so fast because we trimmed a deploy to the smallest thing possible.",

And as the dark environment is aware of feature (why you modify) and version (what your modification is changing), it is safe to do it and test it \"live\" and then deploy it very quickly when you are confident with your modification. In fact, the system is centered on what your intention is (as a programmer) and you can focus on it and not on the tools, and the system is ready to commit your changes with ease.",
