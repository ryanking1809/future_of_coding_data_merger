That was the big so-called innovation of Java, to fix the memory clobberation issue which so plagued C programs. However, it was a half-baked concepted, and gave rise to innumerable nil pointer exceptions in Java programs. I think that OOP was a giant mistake. In my Beads language  there is no NEW operator, which makes things so much more reliable.",
