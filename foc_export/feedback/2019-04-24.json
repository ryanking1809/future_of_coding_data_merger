Like how Socrates was the social gadfly \"to sting people and whip them into a fury, all in the service of truth.\" - Plato on Socrates in his defense.\n<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_gadfly>\n\nRegarding goals, this reminded me of the philosophical question \"Is there true altruism?\"\n\nCompare\n&gt; Research is all about progress.. No ego\nand\n&gt; Alan helped show me that I am professing to be benevolent when I really just wanted to get all the credit for “democratizing programming.”\nvs.\n&gt; It seemed like Alan was asking me to pick: how benevolent do you actually want to be?\n\nIs there no ego in the last one?",
