Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and various other algebraic structures.  In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.",

At the same time, Maraca does only ‘mount’ streams that are currently in use, so the issues are more about the amount of complexity that can be active at one time, not the overall complexity of the app. For example with the <http:\/\/maraca-lang.org|maraca-lang.org> site, only the streams for the current page will be running, so the issues would be how much was going on with any one page, not how many pages the site has. That would apply similarly to things like menus being opened\/closed etc.",
