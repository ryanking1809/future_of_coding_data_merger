But this episode got me over the hump to listen to it, since it was about Lisp. And I was so glad I got to it, because it brought up an idea for my current project that has nothing to do with Lisp.\n\nI've been thinking about a \"personal data server\" as the first use case for my \"human-size computer\", and the notion of \"complex event processing\" (applying FRP to an incoming stream of data) shows me how some of the other projects here connect up concretely with my somewhat _outre_ endeavor.\n\nCreating serendipitous connections between our various projects is the highest aim of this group, I think. This episode achieved that at least for me.",
