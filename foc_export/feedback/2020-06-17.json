Certainly my hands would suffer less RSI if I switched over. I'd appreciate feedback from others.\n\n> 99% of the time you are breaking out of only one level, so make it the default unless you override it with an explicit label.\nYup, that is already the case. Are you seeing the innermost level redundantly specified somewhere? Notice that there's an intervening '{' between `break-if-= $term:loop` and the `$term:loop` label definition (screenshot attached).\n\nI would love to rename registers, but then a reader consulting the Intel manuals has to constantly translate in their minds. I consulted the Intel manuals intensely when I built the lower layers, so it's hard to be sure I've eliminated the need for consulting them by now. I try not to impose unnecessary labor on the reader. Labor I didn't have to perform feels particularly egregious.\n\nThere will likely be a RISC-V or ARM rethinking of Mu at some point, particularly in light of recent news. That will certainly fix the register names.\n\nIn general, I care a lot about minimizing how much a reader has to learn to start reading Mu code. It might sound funny to anyone who's actually tried to read Mu code, but it's very much true. I care more about the reading experience than minimizing characters; I think dropping letters has historically made code less approachable to non-programmers. As I said, I'll keep your feedback in mind, and I'll look for confirming feedback from others.",

I consulted the Intel manuals intensely when I built the lower layers, so it's hard to be sure I've eliminated the need for consulting them by now. I try not to impose unnecessary labor on the reader. Labor I didn't have to perform feels particularly egregious.\n\nThere will likely be a RISC-V or ARM rethinking of Mu at some point, particularly in light of recent news. That will certainly fix the register names.\n\nIn general, I care a lot about minimizing how much a reader has to learn to start reading Mu code. It might sound funny to anyone who's actually tried to read Mu code, but it's very much true. I care more about the reading experience than minimizing characters; I think dropping letters has historically made code less approachable to non-programmers. As I said, I'll keep your feedback in mind, and I'll look for confirming feedback from others."
