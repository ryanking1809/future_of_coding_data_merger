It's a prototype live, functional programming environment centered around data-visibility – all intermediate values are visible by default, and you construct a program by acting on these values. Please take a look, and let me know if you have any thoughts.",

The visual design is certainly far from ideal, but I tried to follow basic principles.\n\nAs for pure\/non-pure functions – PANE is for defining the data-processing parts of a system, so IO isn't in scope. I've been told I'm talking about the \"Functional Core\" part of the \"Functional Core, Imperative Shell\" distinction, which sounds plausible.

        "text": "Hi <@UBKNXPBAB>\n\nI think many of us here are on-board with the concept of being able to (finally!) see the data that we're \"animating\" with our functions or behaviours, so :thumbsup::skin-tone-3: to that! And so I like the corresponding switchover from functions to data as the primary entity on the UI, compared with other box-and-line IDEs.\n\nNow, true logic nerds may have something to say here, but to me it seems that this system may not be Turing Complete, because it looks like you only allow pure functions between data items. This, if true, is missing a critical piece of functionality: the ability to remember past states. As I understand it, this would require either recursive function calling, or circular loops, in your diagrams. I would suggest adding circular loops, not recursion, because recursion is hard to understand and visualise.\n\nOn the subject raised by <@UCKRZS3DZ> - I\/O: you're not far from having it! You do have something rather I\/O-like in the non-pure functions that call out to the remote API service and that call a randomisation function.  You also have I\/O in the output visualisations: you could imagine building a webpage from rendered forms of output data.  And you can play with example values with the mouse, which is kind of like inputs. All you need is to wire in mouse position, buttons, textfields, etc, as your left-hand values (e.g. button up, button down as a boolean input value) and you have a completely general programming system, assuming you have added the circularity feature!",

        "text": "&gt; Curious if A) you see this as a problem and B) how you might go about solving it.\n<@U85MWBKEY> - yes I see this as a *huge* problem. Agree strongly with <@UCUSW7WVD> here. We already had a problem with the repetition in the 3-trier model: db-schema -&gt; [wire schema] -&gt; app server schema -&gt; [wire-schema] -&gt; browser schema. Now this problem has just exploded and continues to grow superlinearly with the number of services involved. The best practices are to make everything optional, check before use, manually chase data flow across services, etc.\n\nI think one key problem is our systems are built with models that make you think 'within the OS process'. When I create a class in Python\/C++\/Java I'm just defining the fields for an object present locally in memory, for that running instance and manually shuffle fields around via RPCs. The 'greater schema' of your user\/data object is an emergent property of the system. Could we start instead from from the greater model and have that represented directly in the system? I think so but it requires throwing away a bunch of existing stuff and moving the ideas of 'database', 'rpc' and 'process' from designed artifacts to generated details.",

For one example, go to <http:\/\/joshuahhh.com\/projects\/pane\/demo\/> and press \"square roots\". There's a function there called \"auto-improve guess\" which calls itself, to iteratively find a good-enough square root for a number. You can press the little \"[+]\" to expand out the recursive calls, which is fun, but pretty unwieldy. As you mention, I think providing a visualizable \"loop\" construct would be more useful, and in particular I think tail recursion is a good foundation for this.\n\nRe: I\/O – The function which calls out to an API is a total hack, and if it had an actual side-effect, or depended on sequencing, rather than being an quasi-pure function, its behavior would be totally unpredictable. Anyway, my present stance is that PANE just isn't suited to making stateful, interactive systems, since it doesn't have visualization schemes (like timelines!) suited to seeing the behavior of stateful, interactive systems. You could try to shoehorn them in, but I think you're better off making a new interface for that kind of stuff.",

This has the problem that to visualise the nested state becomes very hard, as you said and as you showed in the square root example (I don't see how tail recursion really helps there, but I'd like to see your thoughts).\n\nThe not-fully-pure-FP solution (e.g. Onex) allows state as a first class concept and keeps the state \"up at the top\" where you can visualise it more easily. It can do this by allowing looping or circularity. Instead of the result of a pure function application (or the arguments of a recursive call) being new, transient, anonymous states in the call stack, your pure functions can take top-level first class state values as input, and produce new values as output, back in the top-level state they're associated with.\n\nThis makes visualisation much easier - and state chunks, being longer-lived and stable but evolving, can now be given unique identifiers for reference by other chunks.",

PANE is \/almost\/ usable by me. But I have put absolutely no effort into making it usable by anyone other than me. That's because the live demo isn't intended to be the sharable product of the research – the presentation is.\n\nI wanted to put the live demo online so that adventurous folk could mess with it. But now I worry that people may approach it with the wrong expectations, and waste their time or come away with what would be, in my opinion, an unfairly negative opinion of the project.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that was your experience. (Phew!) But I'm worried.\n\n(There's another version of this set of worries for the further step of posting the source code. As you can imagine, \"usability by anyone other than me\" drops exponentially from \"presentation\" to \"live demo\" to \"source code\".)",
