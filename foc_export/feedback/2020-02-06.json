Your second notebook does that in a way, but only for a very narrow application range.\n\nExample: this morning I did a quick data analysis in Python\/Jupyter: 1. read two datasets from an HDF5 file 2. perform a Fourier transform. 3. plot the Fourier transform. If I wanted to do that in Observable, I'd spend a lot more time figuring out how to read HDF5 files and how to do Fourier transforms in JavaScript than getting used to Observable. From that point of view, your tutorials are nice but only a small first step on the learning curve.",
