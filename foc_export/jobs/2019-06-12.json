        "text": "Hi Joe! I tried the Universe app. Usually I’m skeptical about GUIs that claim to make website building “easy”. But there are things I liked in Universe. For example, the domain creation and content update is abstracted away in an interesting way. The grid based layout engine is also fun to play with. \n\nOn a more ideological note, there is much to think about how we could empower web citizens instead of walled gardens consumers.\n\nWhat are you looking for exactly? What kind of additional input would you like in your team?",
