And we already have it for text input on mobile platforms, looking at the examples with Chinese characters and emojis.\n\nI’m using an iPhone right now, and as far as I know there’s no way for me to input a thumbs up emoji followed by a skin tone modifier separately using the built-in keyboard. If you relate that to structural editing like I just did, that would be a syntax error. The onscreen keyboard in iOS prevents me from inputting that incorrect state.\n\nLet’s not forget that the “easy” way of text editing from the past based on ASCII was based on Americans building something that didn’t even consider any other languages, alphabets, scripts, and cultures. That was all bolted on afterwards with code pages until we got to Unicode. Now we have a technology that sort of works for almost every person on the planet who can read and write (and Klingons!) — and that turned out to be a little more complex problem to solve. But I take that over any simple solution that only works by excluding a majority of people based on their language or culture.",

I was more coming from a perspective where you intend to build a product that you hope will have some significant success. We finally start talking about bias in tech and I think that's important for tech in general, and also for the future of coding.\n\nI guess the larger point here is that you shouldn’t be in a position where Unicode support, accessibility, etc. are creating such huge efforts for you. It should just be a foundation you can build on, regardless of what underlying language, environment, and platform you build on. These are areas where we need good solutions so that people like you have a chance to work on important new ideas and still build on an infrastructure that doesn’t exclude people.\n\nThat we don’t live in a world like this yet, isn’t your fault and not your responsibility. But it would be great if we had more people taking on these responsibilities.\n\nAnd in the discussion of exploding complexity it's easy to categorize Unicode as a bloated mess designed by committee. And maybe it is and could be done much better. It's just dangerous to compare it with a simpler past, ignoring the non-technical aspects of the design shortcomings of those simple solutions and fall exactly into the trap that makes many people outside our industry look at us as privileged white nerd boys that dream of changing a world that happens to exclude most of them.",

I can see why this works so well on Twitter. ;-)\n\n&gt;Sounds to me like structural editing is the way forward — even if you’re not editing a programming language, but just Unicode text. And we already have it for text input on mobile platforms, looking at the examples with Chinese characters and emojis.\n\n&gt;I’m using an iPhone right now, and as far as I know there’s no way for me to input a thumbs up emoji followed by a skin tone modifier separately using the built-in keyboard. If you relate that to structural editing like I just did, that would be a syntax error. The onscreen keyboard in iOS prevents me from inputting that incorrect state.\n\nTo add a bit more to this: the complexities of implementing this also could benefit from a more declarative approach. If you read the article, the author is basically describing the rules of how the interaction should behave in the text — that should be more or less directly translated into code, perhaps as rules constraining the movement of the caret\/cursor and which keyboard interactions are possible.",

The layout should be automatically recomputed when the width of the output window changes. So it is the system that chooses where line breaks occur, not the user. The position of line breaks changes when you resize the window. How do you design a syntax for a programming language that is compatible with automatic layout?",

You can just flip back and forth, editing the program first using the text representation, then the graphical representation, and the automatic layout algorithm makes either form look good. The text based syntax is useful for copy and paste of text to\/from the internet, and for people who like typing text and don't mind memorizing syntax. The graphical syntax has the benefits that are associated with visual programming languages, eg node+wire languages. The question is, how do you design an abstract syntax for a programming language that maps onto either of these presentations, and how does the automatic layout work in the two cases?",

There are only graphical representations!\n\nIf you have an old command line terminal in text mode you just happen to have a relatively simple graphical representation that fits same-size glyphs into a fixed grid. So we can abstract that away and think in rows and columns instead of pixels. And that's where we accidentally forget about the translation from logical character position to pixel position because it's completely transparent (and it was even done in hardware back then).\n\nThen you start using proportionally spaced fonts or introduce emojis or start playing with different typefaces and suddenly your glyphs have different sizes and don’t line up that neatly anymore and it gets more complicated. Still just a layout algorithm taking little rectangles and arranging them within larger rectangles.\n\nOnce you can see the nested rectangles, you can arbitrarily play with what gets nested into what and how multiple rectangles on the same level are laid out. And then you're pretty much at the level of arbitrary 2D view hierarchies — what most user interfaces are made out of these days.\n\niOS offers a UI element called collection view, which comes with a flow layout. People use it mostly to arrange photos or graphical elements in rows or columns, filling them up, and then breaking into the next row\/column. That is almost the same algorithm that calculates glyph positions in a paragraph of text and could be generalized to use the same algorithm. For historical reasons though (and because the requirements for text rendering Apple has were always ridiculous) it's not today.",

It supports GPU rendering and GPU compute and a modern performant GPU API, which runs on all of the above platforms, so this has to be WebGPU. I'd like the UI framework to render its graphics using a 2D\/3D graphics API with the same expressive power as Curv, where all graphical objects have a signed distance field that you can manipulate.

Yet I feel a lot of incidental complexity pops up while implementing editors as well. Even when you've figured out all the corner cases and decided their behavior - how do you encode it? How do you detect the layout and  reflow? How do you keep track of events and of different versions of your buffer? The standard APIs dictate a lot here and the usual programming tools limit what you can 'see'. For instance, we don't usually see the layout live as we edit code. Here's an example of what may be possible:",
