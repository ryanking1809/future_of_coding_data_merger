If you think of how you build a synthesizer in that tool, and then add the ability to generate a nice UI for controlling it, then that's the direction I'm going in initially.\n• The second more complex synth I show is modelled on the 'AudioKit Synth One' Open Source synthesizer.  I basically read through their DSP code and figured out how to make my synthesizer have the same layout.  This is a great way to troubleshoot my units and check that I'm getting good quality audio to match an existing sythesizer.  I've found a lot of bugs this way.  What I've learned is that somewhere between generating sine waves and modulating them, and outputting sound, there are lots of tips and tricks to making it sound nice.  I'm a GPU programmer, not an Audio guy, so that's been very helpful.  The above said, it is sometimes interesting how GPU solutions to problems often have parallels in Audio!",

I basically read through their DSP code and figured out how to make my synthesizer have the same layout.  This is a great way to troubleshoot my units and check that I'm getting good quality audio to match an existing sythesizer.  I've found a lot of bugs this way.  What I've learned is that somewhere between generating sine waves and modulating them, and outputting sound, there are lots of tips and tricks to making it sound nice.  I'm a GPU programmer, not an Audio guy, so that's been very helpful.  The above said, it is sometimes interesting how GPU solutions to problems often have parallels in Audio!"
