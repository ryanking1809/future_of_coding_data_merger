First they look at their inputs, and if any of them are 'flow data' or 'control data', they are checked to see if they are current.  If not, the graph walks further up and evaluates until the node inputs are 'current'.  Then it can be computed.  So it's very much a 'pull' architecture.\nI have 3 basic types of 'pins' on my nodes.\n• Flow Data.  This is like a big bundle of data arrays.  The node is expected to work on all data streams it receives in each compute step.  For music, these arrays are typically buffers of audio data; often with 1 buffer per note of polyphony.  \n• Control Data. These are also bundles of arrays, but typically contain control information, such as modulation curves.  It is just convenient for me to separate the concept of control from data.\n• Parameters.  These are just data values such as float, int, etc.  They can be connected to other nodes, but they are not 'evaluated' to satisfy graph compute.  They are considered 'always valid', but that doesn't mean that the node won't walk back up the connection chain of the parameter to find the source value.\nIt should be considered prototype\/research code, but you can see the graph Compute function here: <https:\/\/github.com\/cmaughan\/nodegraph\/blob\/master\/src\/model\/graph.cpp>",
