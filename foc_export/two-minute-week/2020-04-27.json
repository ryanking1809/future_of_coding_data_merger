The oscillator then outputs 3 arrays, each containing, say, 512 audio samples for each of the 3 notes.  The 'output' pin of the oscillator now has 3 internal data streams.  So each unit can operate on the data as a whole.  The next graph node can understand this data and do the right thing.  Imagine that you have 2 oscillators tied into the same note input.  Now you have 2 units emitting the same 3 channels.  If you want to combine the oscillators for each node, then the mixer has no trouble distinguishing the pairs of streams to combine, because each note channel has been tagged with the Id of the note.\n```m_spOutData-&gt;MatchChannelInput(*pFlowData);\nauto&amp; outChannels = m_spOutData-&gt;GetChannels();\nauto&amp; inChannels = pFlowData-&gt;GetChannels();\n\nfor (uint32_t ch = 0; ch &lt; pFlowData-&gt;GetNumChannels(); ch++)\n{\n    for (uint32_t i = 0; i &lt; maud.genFrameCount; i++)\n    {\n        sp_moogladder_compute(maud.pSP, m_vecMoogLadder[ch], &amp;inChannels[ch].data[i], &amp;outChannels[ch].data[i]);\n     }\n}```\nAbove is the simple example of a Low Pass Filter.
