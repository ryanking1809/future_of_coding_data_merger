I’m new to the Future of Coding community, but I do live in NYC and am working on something someone else might be interested in talking\/sketching out with me.\nI’m currently working on a protocol and simple Reactive Database which implements some of the designs behind Dynamicland’s RealTalk language in Rust. The basic concept is anything can make a claim about the world in the form `_ is powered on` (`\"TV:1\" is powered \"on\"`, `\"Toaster1\" is powered \"on\"`) or `_ is near _` (`\"TV:1\" is near \"Person:Steve\"`) and each claim can be queried on such as `When \/thing\/ is powered on, \/thing\/ is near \"Person:Steve\": print(thing); Wish (thing) was turned (\"off\")` which with this fact base would result in wishing that `TV:1` was powered off.",
