        "text": "And for me programming, and especially its tooling, has a huge legacy as an individual activity. And in my experience, when several programmers have to work to create something, if they have an individual behavior and miss some collaborative ones, the result can be bad and it can be a waste of time. And sometime (often ?) the tooling we have now don't help in that: it is mainly designed for individual activity. Even git, it is a collaborative tool with an individual use in mind: one programmer develops on her computer, she commits on her computer, then she pushes on the repository and eventually others pull her modification on their computers to work on it. It is a kind of \"collaborative patch\" on a highly individual workflow.",

Instead of coordinating with others, we find it more efficient to separate us from them and let a merge algorithm do the cooperation for us. And when conflicts emerge, it's a problem, an exception we have to deal with, and we focus — consciously or subconsciously — on the negative connotations.\n\nMaybe our industry has a bias against collaboration? How many people here reading this are (a) working on their own project, and (b) how many of you here are working together on the same project?\nOr what's the first thing you think when you look at code from a different person? Is it more like \"Oh wow, that's interesting — I wonder why they did it like that!\" or more like \"What a mess. I would do this differently.\"\n\nI had an interesting conversation with a film director last week and he was comparing our industry with his. He noticed how collaboration \"isn't much of a thing for most developers\". He is working on some software that's being developed for him, which is why he has lots of interaction with developers lately. He observed: when asked for help, they tend to give quick feedback and opinions, often without showing any empathy for the person seeking help by asking clarifying questions for the situation they're in.\n\nCompared to a film set, every person on that set needs to know what the movie is about and what everyone else is doing and it doesn't matter if you're the director, the sound person, in catering, or whatever — you'll frequently collaborate with other people outside your domain because everything is tightly connected to everything else.\n\nIn software development, we're trying to untangle everything and ideally only have loose coupling everywhere — maybe the most important benefit of that has nothing to do with architecture, but with our desire to focus and work alone?\n\nCan't wait to see what such people come up with in terms of collaborative tools then… :sunglasses:\n\n_I know that's a dark perspective on our industry and collaboration, and I've been deliberately pushing it a little further than I really mean it to make a point._",

Software (particularly the sort of tool-creation endeavor we discuss here) is a long-term activity. I think that explains why our industry rightly holds loose coupling in such high regard.\n\n(_In principle._ To me the high coupling of teams in the software industry (open-plan offices, historical reluctance to let people work remote, etc.) is a symptom of regrettable short-termism in outlook _in practice_. To be fair there's a lot of reason for short-termism in a startup. Which is why I'm suspicious of money, but I won't rehash that conversation.)\n\n&gt; what's the first thing you think when you look at code from a different person? Is it more like \"Oh wow, that's interesting — I wonder why they did it like that!\" or more like \"What a mess. I would do this differently.\"\n\nBased on my browser history, here are some links to projects I spent time reading code for in the past few days:\n\n• <https:\/\/idea.junglecoder.com\/view\/idea\/274>\n• <http:\/\/minimal.linux-bg.org> (I spent 2 weeks understanding this to distill it down to <https:\/\/github.com\/akkartik\/mu\/blob\/master\/gen_iso>)\n• <https:\/\/nurpax.github.io\/posts\/2019-08-18-dirty-tricks-6502-programmers-use.html>\n• <https:\/\/people.kernel.org\/mcgrof\/kdevops-a-devops-framework-for-linux-kernel-development>\n\nI still think your question is valid. I'm fairly unconventional in my interest in reading code, and I think the world would be a better place if more people were like me :angel: My project basically got started by frustrations in reading other people's code. Every codebase is like its own language, and it's too hard to copy\/steal code from others. It doesn't help that people worry about IP law. I had someone tell me recently that they don't want to look at code without a license because of contagion worries _for copyright_. That's either insane or reinforces my determination to learn as little about IP law as possible. Anyways, I'll stop rambling here :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks for a great comment <@U5STGTB3J>.",
