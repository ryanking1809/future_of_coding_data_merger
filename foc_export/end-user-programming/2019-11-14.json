        "text": "Lately I try to use GSheets a lot. I write custom formulas and its tests in typescript and upload them via <https:\/\/github.com\/google\/clasp> . It is quite nice. To catch errors (unintended use of a formula) and make it visible to the formula user (myself atm, but that might change) I create “error cells” and\/or conditional formatting.\n\nTo me, being able to inspect the pure data itself has a lot of value, because in a pipeline things might go wrong and it is nice to be able to have a glance at all the data.\n\nMy question is: do you have any best practice \/ advice to work with google sheets \/ excel, especially considering TESTS?",
