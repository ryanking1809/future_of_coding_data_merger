        "text": "hi! I'm Mariano Guerra, Software Engineer (actually Information Systems Engineer but close) from Argentina, currently living in Stuttgart, I like Distributed Systems, Swarm Intelligence\/Emergent Systems and more specific to this group, creating programming languages, I created \"standard\" ones like efene[1] and more visual ones, two of them products that I developed and are my current source of income, the old one Event Fabric[2]: a data flow\/scratch mix that ended up being more complex for customers to understand than what I expected. From the lessons learned from that one I developed a new one from scratch (no pun intended) called instadeq[3], which later I found out is part of a family of programming languages known as programming by demonstration (knowing about them before starting would have made it faster to develop it :slightly_smiling_face:).  Last October we migrated our customers from event fabric to instadeq and now we are focusing on launching the SaaS version of it.\n\n[1]  <http:\/\/efene.org\/>\n[2] <https:\/\/www.event-fabric.com\/>\n[3] <https:\/\/instadeq.com\/>",
