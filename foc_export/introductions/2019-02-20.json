        "text": "<@UCUSW7WVD> - Totally agree about \"bumpers\".\n\nAfter trying to make my own super-self-aware programming language, I discovered that languages themselves are also just \"bumpers\"!\n\nIf you think of a complier as an interpreter, and source code written in a compiled language as the code to \"interpret\", then that code is actually just an *interpreted* program written in a funny declarative language that can only do one thing: generate a compiled program. The statements are all like \"create a new instance of class, like this\" or \"create this AST like this\", all followed by a giant implicit command to generate machine code (or something else) from it.\n\nIf you replace a compiler with a set of libraries for creating, manipulating, and processing AST structures (i.e. code represented as data), then you could use it however you want (e.g. selectively), customize it, supplement it with your own stuff, and\/or combine language features -- because it's all just functions that you call.",
