I wanted to share a bit about you with the community...\n\nJP and I met super randomly at a hackathan and collaborated on this <https:\/\/stevekrouse.com\/hs.js>. JP is known most recently for his work on the open-source Dynamicland-inspired Paper Programs <https:\/\/paperprograms.org\/>. But JP has also done a ton of other incredibly impressive work that this community would find fascinating and can be seen on his site here <http:\/\/janpaulposma.nl\/>. And JP is one of the kindest people I know!",
