        "text": "<@UL3CJ7YKC> Hi there, almost the same trajectory in the academic side and have felt this dissatisfaction myself. I totally get your itch to write elegant code and I have explored some of the things you have mentioned there. And your feeling of coming out unsatisfied with those methods is on point, because most of those fields are actively researched. As you intuited, logic is indeed the place I arrived at to finally understand what is going on.\n\nI am out of my depth about the last statement of making market value capture by learning logic (though theoretically possible). But if that's not a priority I can show some ways up the abstraction hierarchy that might unite all of CS and help you probably arrive at at least one good way to express your programs elegantly (Mind you, it would be a big dump of pointers which I haven't myself untangled but shows great promise. So it would be like someone lost sharing his bits of the map he collected on his way).",
