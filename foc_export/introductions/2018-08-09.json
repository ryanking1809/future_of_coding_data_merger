        "text": "Hey <@UC6997THT>, I’ve just read your “Life Goals 2018” blog post. Two paragraphs in, I was hooked. I worked at Apple seven years, quit two years ago, and I can relate to everything you write. I’m also in a finding phase, living off my Apple savings, still with enough runway so I’m exactly in that position where it’s comfortable enough to explore whatever, and not uncomfortable enough to get your ass kicked into action. On good days I’m trying to push some projects forward that I consider meaningful, on other days I’m in that “the planet’s going to shit” mood (climate change, politics, etc.) that’s not helping with anything.\n\nThen you write about cancer. Over the last few months, I’ve been spending many hours talking with a good friend once a week during his chemotherapy. We used to work at Apple together, so we talk about the company, technology in general, and the future — stuff we love talking about. Last week they told him they have to stop the chemotherapy, because his body is so weak that it would kill him before the cancer does. I feel like that’s life giving me the (index) finger so I pay attention, because life can give you the (middle) finger anytime.\n\nYou live in Japan? Well, where are we going to eat? I’m coming to Tokyo next Wednesday, staying for 10 days in Roppongi. Let’s meet for coffee or food!",
