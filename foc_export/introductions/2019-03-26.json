(Latter Scriabin of course, e.g. the two Symponies\/Poems and as you mentioned, the piano works). Mysterium - wasn’t that a work to be performed on a mountain in India during the end of the world? Got to get into this stuff more! Too much careerism can sap one’s spirituality. :slightly_smiling_face:",

        "text": "Coltrane ranges from super mellow to unbearable atonality\/harshness. The album he did with Johnny Hartman is one of the most mellow records you will ever hear. There is also a compilation called the \"gentle side of JC\" that is particularly pleasant. His wife Alice Coltrane was no slouch either, and she made a lot of spacey harp music at the same time as he was doing his stuff. Coltrane got into heroin and then kicked it so there an intensity in his work, depending on his physical state, that is quite extreme. And of course you are getting McCoy Tyner who is super great. Tyner still performs a bit, he is one of the only survivors of that era. sorry i misspelled Durufle earlier. He wrote very little music, but his Requiem i believe is even nicer than Faure's. And also worth checking out is Cannonball Adderly &amp; Nancy Wilson. She was just a kid at the time, her first record, and it is spectacular. Youth is so beautiful.",
