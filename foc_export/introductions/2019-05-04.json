I've been kind of disappointed with the garbage collection proposal and the fact that they've broken work on Wasm into several different proposals - I thought it needed to be designed more holistically, likely with the objects\/GC system as a centerpiece. I've been wanting to design a low-level type system for the GC system but I figured they'd just ignore me if I proposed something, particularly since I didn't keep up with all the other developments since the Wasm MVP.",
