        "text": "I don't think coding bootcamps are a good place for new languages, because most of the camps i have seen are focused on getting people into commercial readiness of some kind and training on something that is bleeding edge would seem disappointing to the students because when they get out they will be likely compelled to use some very conventional language, as few beginners have design or language authority. Only powerful, established talent can buck the system and inject a new language, or the sole practitioner who doesn't care what anyone else is doing. After working on a gigantic C program for a year with 12 others, i was sick of the contamination and error injection caused by people changing interfaces, and sought a better language, and settled on Modula-2, which was so commercially productive for me i kept using it for 20 years. This is why smaller projects have very profitably used less popular languages. Even ancient technologies like LISP will sometimes show up inside products; in the hands of a skilled practitioner anything is possible.\n\nthat being said, it would be a lot more fun, and a lot easier, to train people in a bootcamp using one of the new languages which drastically reduces the total amount one has to learn. With a total of 20 function calls you should be able to build a chess program for an iPad and a web browser. And omniscient debugging makes it a lot less frustrating. This is the double whammy coming, which will be dramatic moment for the software industry; the combination of simplification with a major reduction in what i call the frustration of not being able to reverse an effect back to its cause.",

I have two on-going projects in that area: ActivePapers (<http:\/\/www.activepapers.org\/>) is about structuring and documenting scientific methods implemented in software, and Leibniz (<https:\/\/github.com\/khinsen\/leibniz\/>) is about taking scientific models out of software source code and giving them a life of their own (call it \"reifying\" if you need a technical term).",

A computer for me is a tool to work with digital information, with the information being more important than the tool. Much of today's digital information is held hostage by code. This covers proprietary data formats, overly complex or undocumented data formats, and information absorbed by (and hidden in) software source code.

A lot of us actually share a similar sentiment: that a computer should be able to be whatever people make it to be, and one should have full ownership &amp; authorship of their own data, artifacts, and tools -- and in the ways that make the most sense (e.g. not just by code &amp; programming).\n\nThe \"computer\" is a universal simulation machine that can be made to do, model, or simulate just about anything -- but somehow fails to actually provide that capability to the one using it! That's like if all scissors came in that hard plastic packaging that's darn near impossible to open without scissors!\n\nImagine a material that can be manipulated to take-on any physical properties or shape, but can *only* be manipulated by tools made from that same material. Even with only very crude tools to start with, it would not be hard make better tools (including better tool-making-tools) to whatever level of exactness one desires. -- But that's *essentially* what \"software\" is: the most dynamic and moldable substance possible, and created and manipulated by other software.\n\nI'm working on a tool that explores such an approach, by serving as an editor &amp; viewer for software entities, including its own innards -- and thus can mold anything (including itself) in whatever way is best.",

Unfortunately, to define data we need data types (or data formats etc.) and to define behaviour we need code. And these two constructs depend on each other: code manipulates data (if we don’t need that, then we don’t need computers). So helping scientists work with their data fundamentally comes down to helping them work with data types\/formats and code. Sometimes that code is hidden in UI widgets (and whether this is a good thing is hotly debated). So I focus a lot on how to design programming languages and tools because working with code is simply a nightmare in today’s world. I’m not targeting scientists in particular, but I am working on how to make modelling (and comprehending) systems easier, which is something that scientists need.",

Here's an example from the readme, slightly reindented:\n```MANY blog_posts {\n  id, title, body,\n  comments: MANY comments {\n    id, body,\n    author: ONE users {\n      name\n    },\n  }\n}```\n…and yes, as shown in the readme, the response is a whole tree as JSON.\n\nre: how to do live queries: this code path: :stuck_out_tongue: <https:\/\/github.com\/vilterp\/treesql\/blob\/master\/pkg\/live_queries.go#L94-L101>\nBasically, when a live query is first run, it saves \"listeners\" in a special data structure in memory. Later, when writes come in, we look up those listeners, find live queries interested in that write, and push it out to them.\n\nThere's nothing that makes it fundamentally easier to do that in a document store than in a relational database. CockroachDB (where I work) is built on top of a key-value store, as are document DBs, and we have one of the building blocks of live queries: changefeeds (<https:\/\/www.cockroachlabs.com\/docs\/stable\/create-changefeed.html>), a way of getting a feed of writes going into the DB. The tricky part is mapping these writes to the queries that would be interested in them — i.e. \"a comment with blog post id 5 was inserted =&gt; these 11 queries covered blog post 5, so they'd want to know about this\"",
