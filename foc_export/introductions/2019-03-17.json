I spent some time with Smalltalk and Lively, I was an intern at CDG\/HARC and I also ended up working on live programming for my PhD studies at University of California, Santa Cruz. I recently finished my thesis which tries to somewhat bridge live programming and static program verification (you can read more at <http:\/\/chris-schuster.net\/thesis|chris-schuster.net\/thesis>). I'm currently in the Bay Area.\n\nI'm also a frequent listener of Future of Coding podcast and I'm joining this Slack channel to get some news and updates.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Robin Allison. I want to understand stuff. I studied pure math in undergrad and grad school for a year. I studied math because I could get it and obsessed over algebraic topology because more than any other subject because I couldn't get it. That wasn't good for my career but its given me a unique perspective on math and I'm grateful for that. I read Michael Nielsen's essay \"Reinventing Explanation\" which eventually let me understand Bret Victor. I came to the conclusion that my understanding was limited by the representations we used, and that by inventing my own I could better understand.\n\nI've had two personal victories, one with spectral sequences and one with the proof of the cellular boundary, in designing better representations using static media. I'm working on better representing the computation of the homology of the projective plane using the decomposition RP^2 = e^2 \\cup e^1 \\cup e^0, extending the previous techniques. I hope that these \"prototypes\" can convince other mathematicians the merits and unexplored possibilities of design, leaving aside the possibilities of dynamic media. Additionally I speculate heavily on how we interface with mathematical ideas, motivated by whats probably considered low working memory and expressive language capabilities for math.\n\nIn my experience it is extremely difficult to get other mathematicians to think about the kinds of ideas talked about here. I think part of the problem is that the solution is outside of math whereas for coding at least the solution is still code and has a historical basis in the work of Alan Kay etc.  So I hope I can hang out here until mathematics expands to consider \"design\" a part of math too. :slightly_smiling_face:",

For one, mathematics is at its core the study of pattern, and computer programming is very messy and patterns are hard to come by. Also, it doesn't lend itself to any proofs, because even a simple game like Snake can't be proven to be perfect, partly because there are subjective\/aesthetic aspects to defining \"correct\" in a game. I myself am interested in measuring robustness in computer programs, especially as it relates to comparing two languages. Which language has the lowest propensity for error? Can one through the design of a language, make it much more difficult o create an error? I call it the Calculus of Error, and after using Modula-2 for example when everyone else was using C, i found that M2 programs were smaller, faster, and much more reliable, so there are intrinsic characteristics in a language which are measurable. In our industry we haven't been willing to tell the truth about the weaknesses in various languages, preferring to categorize things as mere preference. Without measurement you have fad and fashion.",
