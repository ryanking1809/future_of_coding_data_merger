I’ve been interested in alternative visions of programming for a few years now, following Bret Victor and Eve etc., but don’t have any projects of my own. My PhD research isn’t about programming but it somewhat overlaps with the kind of interfaces championed by Bret and Dynamicland. It’s still early days here though.",
