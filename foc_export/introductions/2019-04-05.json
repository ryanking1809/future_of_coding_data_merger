        "text": "Yes, MPS is the closest thing I'm aware of that's actually available. Unfortunately I haven't spent much time actually using it, so I can't really comment on specific differences except very superficially, ie. Intentional's tooling was based on C#\/.NET instead of Java. \nThe one time I tried it was many years ago, iirc the only thing I tried was to rename a thing and see if the references updated, which iirc they didn't. I don't know if I misunderstood something, am misremembering, or if they've fixed that since, but such an edit would have impossible with Intentional's representation; names were a property of the thing, not references to the thing. This was core; you could have any number of names assigned to something - i18n for your variables, both short and long names, etc. At one point we added \"friendly\" names to some of our core language features, which were originally named with Hungarian notation :)",

Every node in the source tree had a unique identity, so we could directly tell the difference between \"delete\/insert\" and \"move\". If we couldn't apply a change cleanly, we'd insert information about the conflict into the document. (The \"conflict\" domain was simply another language that could be freely intermixed into any document due to the flexibility of our tree representation.) Charles patented this as \"Perfect Source Control\".",
