        "text": "I was an early user of APL. It is an extremely powerful and compact language. Promoted by IBM in the early 70's, it originally ran as a terminal language under a time sharing mainframe. Its lamentable decision to use an invented alphabet was finally corrected by Iverson late in his life, and he rebooted it as J to compete against Mathematica. J continues onwards, and is a more modern version of APL. Keep in mind that APL was effectively a character graphics type of interface, and in its day was leaps and bounds ahead of any other system. APL is so powerful and dense, it is what many of us call a \"write-only\" language, where anyone but the original author has little chance of understanding a program of any size.",

Thank you!\n\nBut to get on a pet hobby horse for a second and dwell on a single, throwaway paragraph:\n\n_\"A programmer is ideally an essayist, who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts to communicate the way that an algorithm works, and to convince the reader that it is correct.\"_ -- Donald Knuth (1992)\n\nThe fundamental reason programmers can't be essayists is that essayists don't get paid. The niche of essayists who get paid a living is _miniscule_.\n\nI'm always torn when I hear this quote and others like it. On the one hand it violently feeds my biases, but on the other hand the person quoting it is usually describing Literate Programming or the value of readable code to an (at this point imaginary?) audience that hasn't heard of it, and is content to point out the gap between where we are and where we want to be, without delving into the reasons for the gap. It makes it seem like pointing out the problem is the hard part, and now that it's pointed out everyone can go forth and write glorious essays in their code.\n\nThere were no essayists when writing happened on clay tablets. Its only purpose then was tracking shopping lists [1] and at best the occasional bit of business correspondence [2]. Programming is in a similar state at the moment.\n\n[1] <https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/sumeriantabletsf00bedauoft\/sumeriantabletsf00bedauoft_djvu.txt>\n[2] <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-nasir>",

In my music community, the most tech-savvy fusionists are women. But (with the exception of my daughter), I think they all have to fight so hard to be respected and acknowledged for their skill that they don't have the liberty to look at ripping up the foundations and remaking programming in their image. I wish things were different.",
