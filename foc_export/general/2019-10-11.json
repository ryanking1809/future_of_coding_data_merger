Especially when working on something that’s FoC related, most of dependencies weren’t meant by the developer to be used like that - I noticed how much work I had when I tried to use a generic “code editor” dependency and realized I’d be better off having to reimplement the whole text editor on my own again because it failed failed.\n\nFaster iterations really do allow you to write more performant code - When you get the system in your head with the 1st, you already know the edge cases you covered and can probably find a better way to handle it all easily for v2. And then in V2 you get to explore even more of the problem by having the “mental map” of the system already, so you can navigate the concepts more easier, merge them, discard them, find new ones.\n\nIt’s like moving into a new city: At first, you’re lost and find a few places (store, barber, bakery, coffee shops) near to cover your basic needs. And sometimes you get lost in the bad part of the city trying to find them. But you notice they’re too far away and you know what you need now (and what part of the city to avoid) so you say screw that, go to explore and notice that you can get a better coffee in the shop 2 streets away and grab bread on the way back (maybe even in the same bakery, maybe not. at least you know it’s there and it’s an option), so now you go there and grab better coffee and bread faster instead of just sticking to V1, :runner: running to the same bakery and coffee shop, spilling coffee all over you and saying “look at me, i’m optimizing!”",

One thing we've suspected is that taking VC money would constrain your ability to execute against the long time-lines required to do really ambitious work, and I'm curious whether in retrospect you found that significant? I also *completely* agree that if you don't design for performance at the beginning, you (probably) can't get it at the end. It's such a fundamental and formative constraint.",

        "text": "<@ULM3U6275> Having made software for dumb people a good part of my career, i can easily tell that the Self system would baffle a majority of end users who are beginning programmers. Only a person with the concept of class hierarchies strongly embedded in their skull could possibly use it. That it allows override of a method for a single instance of a variable vs. for the class is such a huge \"gotcha\" he has to mention it in the first tutorial. That you have to warn users from the get-go about a giant pit of bafflement that awaits you is not a good sign. It isn't a question of personal taste, it is a question of ease of learning and use, and to require pre-requisite knowledge as this system does, would make it an instant fail.  There are plenty of smart people who do can handle abstraction, and those people naturally gravitate to LISP, FORTH, Haskell, etc., but when you hand over a large code base written in this system to someone else other than the author, what happens then? What are the chances that the new maintainer can modify and extend that system? This is the big issue companies face every day, when software lasts 20+ years yet people move around every few years, so multiple generations of hand-offs have to execute smoothly, like  a relay race. The relay race is the sport that is being run in our industry, and if i was given a large Self product to maintain (like the editor itself) I wouldn't have a clue as to how to discover how it works.",
