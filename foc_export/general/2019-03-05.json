It also eliminates the differences between variable name lengths which varies between programmers, and should be ignored when trying to compare overall input effort.  Then you take two programs written in different languages, count the words, and then you see if there is any great productivity difference.",

You put the programs side by side and you can see the advantages\/disadvantages of the various syntaxes. Notation matters, and as the test programs grow in complexity you really start to see a divergence in the quality of the code. By the time you get to a chess program which is about 1500 words, some toolchains\/languages start to get cumbersome. if you include in the specification a requirement that the user interface adapt to the resolution of the device it is on, then things really get ugly, and many people then fall back to very complex graphical framework add-ons, which are more complex to learn than the language itself. This what i call the \"graphical pitfall\", where you go into a black pit of complexity trying to handle drawing gracefully. Forget the days of hard-coded XY coordinates in your programs, that is long gone, unless you treat the whole screen as a rubber rectangle that is squished. But that doesn't work in the end, because if you have a big screen you might change how many columns you use. Since many programs need to be graphical nowadays, unless you are limiting yourself to server-side only, you better tackle the layout problem in the language or else you are just ducking one of the main requirements.",

But some of the other efforts include a database in the language. Some languages will include a drawing system, some use a library like Red which has a  domain specific language for rendering. Others just dump you into CSS\/HTML\/JS type of drawing. I think this is the most important design decision in the language itself: will it have a database inside? will it include drawing?  If the answer is no to both, how will you actually get past current state of the art? Can you honestly expect to bury Java and Python and C++ without those two things? I think that is a very interesting question.",

        "text": "Couple of meta-questions from a newcomer after skimming through the history of this channel (and <https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/> - maybe this could be in the topic?).\n\nContext for the questions is an incongruence between our own startup and the apparent, somewhat abstract and academic focus of this community.\nI'm looking to understand what people look for in this community, what kind of meaning, what incentives keeps everyone here? Sharing of thoughts, obviously; but there are always the questions of personal careers, fame, money, status. All of those nasty cynical things yet which in the end make all the difference.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for what could we (our company) give and what could we potentially look for; to figure out how it could be worth our time to engage deeply and not just lurk and absorb any ideas?\n\nI'll expand on the context a bit. On one hand the thing we're building ticks (very) many of the boxes people are looking for here. This is why I'm opening my mouth now, actually. On the other hand we already 'have found the answers' for great many practical questions. So I feel like I couldn't sincerely participate in the high-level discussions which are based on \"let's try to figure things out together\", because, well, we've figured many things out already, committed to them, and are now going through the phase of actually implementing the stuff.\n\nI'll pick one concrete, central example: our language is javascript, enchanced with a transparent ORM to a global workspace of shared resources - powerful, familiar, but offers absolutely no chance for fundamental language design innovation. This would basically rule us out the interests of any people here for whom new language design is The Thing, The Reason To Be Here; maybe because they have a language research oriented academic career, maybe because of personal aspirations; maybe because this channel originates from a discussion group whose identity is new language design. And this is just one example, there are a lot of other similar ones.\n\nSo finally, the personal question: if I \"can't\" participate in discussions sincerely without being an advocate, and I \"can't\" just expect people to jump on-board of our existing train of answers, but I still genuinely believe we've what it takes to answer the core problems put forth here, what should I do?",

        "text": "<@UAL7940NM>: Yeah, I was explicitly trying to focus on areas where I'm likely to disagree with most people. Giving the `diff`s, as it were. That way if someone agreed with me, that would be a very strong signal indeed.\n\nAll three stem from my basic focus: on rewarding the curiosity of outsiders to a codebase. And that focus splits up into a long-term and a short-term component. In the long term, I think conventional wisdom in those three areas has costs that society consistently ignores. Somebody should explore the other side. In the short term, the prototype I'm building needs all three properties to reliably falsify my hypotheses.\n\n• _Minimize dependencies_: because most libraries today are unreliable\/leaky, they make it harder for newcomers to tell where to look for answers to certain questions, and they give worse answers (\"this function should give this answer but gives this instead\", vs \"version x of Foo is incompatible with version y of Bar\")\n\n• _Minimize languages_: because every language used by a project adds to the burden of prerequisites a reader has to know before they can make the small change they care about.\n\n• _Encourage forking_: because at a fundamental level what runs on my laptop has no reason to be identical to what the rest of the world runs. Ease of upgrading and merging are secondary concerns. They still need to be solved, yes, and I'm working on that. But _designing_ the way we distribute software to make upgrading easy seems like the tail wagging the dog. My system is harder to comprehend because the hard disk drivers on it are also optimized for running high-throughput servers. It's also harder to get changes that help _me_ merged upstream because the authors care less about my use case. Why not just have a fork that caters to a smaller segment of the market that is more like me, and drop all the bloat that we don't need?",

                "text": "The object-capability model is a computer security model. A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object. It can be obtained by the following combination:\n\nan unforgeable reference (in the sense of object references or protected pointers) that can be sent in messages.\na message that specifies the operation to be performed.The security model relies on not being able to forge references. \n\nObjects can interact only by sending messages on references.\nA reference can be obtained by:initial conditions: In the initial state of the computational world being described, object A may already have a reference to object B.\nparenthood: If A creates B, at that moment A obtains the only reference to the newly created B.\nendowment: If A creates B, B is born with that subset of A's references with which A chose to endow it.\nintroduction: If A has references to both B and C, A can send to B a message containing a reference to C. B can retain that reference for subsequent <http:\/\/use.In|use.In> the object-capability model, all computation is performed following the above rules.\nAdvantages that motivate object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation or information hiding, modularity, and separation of concerns, correspond to security goals such as least privilege and privilege separation in capability-based programming.\nThe object-capability model was first proposed by Jack Dennis and Earl C. Van Horn in 1966.",
