The group is relatively new, the idea is to meet once a month (first monday although this month we're doing July 10th) and the kind of unifying theme has been new interfaces for programming.  It was kind of a freeform discussion last time, but I think it'd be interesting if one or two people talk about a project (either theirs or something they've tried) at each meeting to kind of seed the conversation, but pretty open to format",
