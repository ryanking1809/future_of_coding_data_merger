Sure PDAs had been around for 10+ years before iPhone, Nokia phones and other Symbian devices had all of the capabilities as iPhone at launch (and often more), but Apple marketed and streamlined the experience enough to get people actually using the device.  I get your point, Apple's contribution was improved UX (as it often is), but for the majority of smartphone users those Nokia devices, or Windows Mobile, or whatever might have not existed because they were viewed as inaccessible (and often were!) or unnecessary.",

        "text": "<@UE6EFEPTQ> — Are you arguing that the delta of the iPhone over what came before is largely just the touchscreen? What of Cocoa, and Safari, and the relentless focus on performance in the creation of iPhoneOS? What of the pressure on the carriers to expand data coverage and speed? What of the marketing muscle of Apple — for instance, spreading the term \"App\" beyond tech circles? The touchscreen was a huge enabler, but putting a full-size capacitive touchscreen on a Palm or Moto Q wouldn't have led to those devices or their progeny becoming the preeminent computing platform of our era.\n\nThe DynamicLand comparison holds. The fact that Bret Victor has a lot of sway over our community is earned and, hell, might even be a factor that contributes to the success of DL where AR and the original Surface did not succeed. But ignoring that, DynamicLand might _mostly_ be \"just a user interface idea\", but it's certainly not _only_ that. You can see the difference by looking at the Paper Programs project (<https:\/\/paperprograms.org>) which is a duplication of the UI with none of the other characteristics — no tuple space-inspired programming model, no RealTalk OS posted up on the wall for anyone to read, no \"it's a building, not a program\" augmentation of the environment around you, no cultural knowledge of the others around you to immerse yourself in when visiting the space. Aside from the website, pretty much every example I've seen of people using Paper Programs has them projecting it onto the wall, because it's a pain in the ass to hang a projector from your ceiling, which means you have a completely different relationship with the UI than is intended. Paper Programs is a cool exploration of the space, but it throws away so much of what makes DynamicLand what it is, and you can see the result of that by looking at what people are doing with Paper Programs, versus what they're doing with DL.\n\nNot unlike looking at what people did with the post-2007 BlackBerry, Palm, and Moto devices that featured a full-size capacitive touchscreen, versus what people (especially developers) did with the iPhone.",

He knew something was wrong when people began to invite him to conferences to talk about programming tools. “Everyone thought I was interested in programming environments,” he said. Really he was interested in how people see and understand systems—as he puts it, in the “visual representation of dynamic behavior.” Although code had increasingly become the tool of choice for creating dynamic behavior, it remained one of the worst tools for understanding it. The point of “Inventing on Principle” was to show that you could mitigate that problem by making the connection between a system’s behavior and its code immediate.\n\nMost of us are programmers here so it may be we're just looking at Dynamicland as a programming system. I feel the essence of the research isn't about programming at all, but more about thinking\/understanding\/sharing. It's a whole new medium of external representations. E.g. we have writing\/books\/drawings, video\/tv, interactive screens as various existing mediums of representations. In theory each of these is 'just a UI' - in the sense it interfaces with the user. But each evolves different ways in how it helps people think, share and collaborate. Maybe Dynamicland is an 'interactive physical space' medium.",
