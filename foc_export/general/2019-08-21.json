        "text": "Dear Daniel, i wouldn't spend too much time on pure logic. One of the famous math books of the 20th century was Whitehead &amp; Russell's Principia Mathematica, and it used a custom symbology, which drove the printers crazy because this was early 1900's. If i recall correctly it takes them over 100 pages of complete gibberish to prove that 1 + 1 = 2. If you need to sleep that book is infallible. We all know that 1 + 1 is two but a proof of this is surprisingly difficult. And this is where the risk lies in studying problems that are invented by academics. Most of the great breakthroughs in science and math were from people trying to solve a real problem in the world, like the motions of the planets, which inspired Newton, Lagrange, or cracking the Enigma code by Turing's computers, and so many others. When people invent their own problems to solve you head dangerously into \"how many angels dance on the head of a pin\" territory which so plagued medieval thinkers who never looked out into the world.  I remember seeing the first category theory book decades ago, and was intrigued by it, but that branch of mathematics is littered with problems that don't matter to anyone but the people getting degrees. I can't think of a language or a tool that i use on a regular basis in computers that was developed at a university since 1980's Modula-2\/Oberon from my idol Prof. Wirth of ETH, or Icon from Griswold at Univ. of Arizona also around 1980.",

The \"level mapping\" idea (which I haven't run across before) seems like it's just a formalization of this, where you assign numbers to predicates according to their stratum.\n\nYou can also think in terms of dependency graphs between predicates instead of numbering strata explicitly, which I prefer. Let every predicate be a node, and make an edge from A to B if there's a rule with A in the head &amp; B in the body. Call the edge \"negative\" if B appears negated. Then a graph is stratified if every cycle has only *positive* edges; put another way, cycles aren't allowed to have negated edges.",

        "text": "For the umpteenth time I share the kernel of Edward de Jong's concern -- and find the broad opinions extrapolated from it wildly inappropriate. Evolution is robust because it proceeds along many directions at once. I am constantly thankful that it takes all sorts to make a world, and that there are others blazing trails in directions I don't care to go.\n\nThere are many well-known examples of ideas that seemed incredibly abstract and divorced from reality -- until they suddenly turned out to be useful in understanding our world. To name just one, I believe Gauss's _remarkable theorem_ (<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Theorema_Egregium>) was considered for almost a hundred years a classic case of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin -- until Einstein used it in General Relativity.\n\n(It's true that the massive increase in funding for the sciences over the last 100 years has created perverse incentives for bullshit academic activity. But I want to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath-water. And I say this as a disgruntled ex-academic.)\n\n---\n\nIt is a common mis-phrasing to say that _Principia_ \"takes over 100 pages to prove that `1+1 = 2`\". It takes 100 pages to show that a specific system of logic actually connects up with the numbers as others know and recognize them.",

It is just an observation that although the funding and number of computer science depts. has exploded since 1980 we have little to show for it. We have reached a point where many of the professors only talk to each other, and don't interact with industry. They communicate in journals that might cost $1000 a year to subscribe to, which means no regular person will ever see their work. There are lot of things wrong with academia. It's gotten pretty decadent, with administrators getting 7 figure salaries and flying in the school's private jet. Smaller schools are actually suffering, but the top ones are rolling in money. My good friend paul was at UC Berkeley in the 70's and the students protested and went on strike because the tuition was being raised $50 a quarter or something like that. Now many students are leaving with six figure debt, and here in the states we have a crisis brewing with over a trillion in student loans outstanding. Unfortunately, there seems to be a very weak connection at present between industry and academic computing.",

Text files already provide roughly the same sequence of operations to update. Can anybody tell what the article expects the benefits of databases to be? I see something about the CPU cycles to parse text files. But that seems to perversely ignore the complexities of using a database.\n\nAnother take: your file system already has much that looks like a database with journalling and so on. Mission accomplished?\n\nPersonal note: I've looked at several papers this week and been tempted to go implement them. This is a big shift compared to the past 5 years, while I've been slowly putting the foundations of the Mu computer together. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I can start prototyping new ideas again. Anybody want to play with adding a stupid database before a file system? The Mu computer currently has no access to its local file system, so we have a blank slate to play with.",
