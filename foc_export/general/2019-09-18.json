        "text": "Whenever the conversation moves into interchangeable parts, my ears perk up. The first big win in software reuse\/parts was the FORTRAN scientific libraries fo rmainframes in the 60-70's. There were about 1000 functions you could use, open source, that ran on a broad set of compilers. These projects were the output typically of someone's master or PhD thesis, and contributed to FORTRAN's dominance in the scientific world. The next big re-use ecosystem was VB6. As Bill Gates' pet project inside Microsoft (BASIC was the founding product of MS), it was given significant resources and bright people, and VB6 until MS dismantled it with their Java-envy .NET project, had a thriving marketplace. With plug-ins for all sorts of user interface components, many of which were sold under license, and there were stores you could go to buy and download components, that worked perfectly in that very uniform environment where all the components were controlled by simple tables of parameters. I have met many a programmer who build incredibly rich user interfaces and deep products in VB6.\n\n<@ULM3U6275> makes some great points, that programs do last for decades, and that maintenance costs far outweigh the cost of construction. That was also true for the golden gate bridge by the way, the total cumulative cost of running the bridge is probably over 20 times the construction cost. I would say that software has a similar ratio over the up to 25 year lifespan of programs used in business.\n\nIf you make software super easy to build, then you don't care about re-use as much.\n\nThere are many ways to improve programming, many of which don't conflict with each other: 1) simplifying the debugging process with reversible computing, 2) creating a better standard for data interchange than the  idiotic JSON, which is not a binary format and therefore crippled and inefficient, 3) making it so client products can send a \"blackbox\" recording to the developers so that bugs are 100% repeatable instead of the current mess where most bug reports in big companies are effectively ignored until they become statistically significant. 4) make it easier for people to understand other people's code, and 5) make the interchangeable pieces smaller so there is less duplication of work.\n\nAt present, i hardly ever use Github as a resource. Most of the code is of unknown quality, poorly documented, and oftentimes the dependency chain is a dealbreaker. Eliminating dependencies would help a lot with interchangeability frankly.",

        "text": "Interesting discussion, thanks!\n\nWhen talking about reuse, it's important to distinguish between diversity and duplication. For example, there may be two JSON implementations where one is optimized for memory footprint and the other for execution time. It may be impossible to combine both use cases in a single implementation. Requiring a single standard would limit diversity in this case. On the other hand, there may also be implementations that only differ in non-essential details like function names. Combining these would reduce duplication without hurting diversity.\n\nIMO, we should strive for as much diversity as possible (and document this!) while reducing duplication where possible. In the JSON example this would probably reduce the number of implementations from 20 to 5 which would make choosing an impl easier and therefore shift the \"reuse vs. build yourself\" decision towards reuse. 3 of these impls could probably even use the same API, making switching between them trivial. Each of these impls should document alternatives and when to use them.\n\nOSS has been great at allowing diversity (e.g. by forking), but it doesn't do well on reducing duplication. We probably need tools and an attitude towards \"joining\" as the inverse to forking.",

        "text": "<@UJBAJNFLK> But once you know the reusable component, the argument is reversed, right? I've used pd.read_csv in a couple of places already and I'd say I know how it works. So for me, it's easier to understand usages of pd.read_csv compared to some hacked-together csv reader. The pd.read_csv function applies too much magic IMO, but that's not the point. Reusable components also mean that there's less to learn and keep in mind for developers, which is a good thing. Having five different csv parsers, I'd need to check all of them for details like handling of trailing commas, emty lines, ... A single reusable component that covers 80% of the common use cases only needs to be learned once. Apart from that, pd.read_csv might also contain optimizations that you'd never implement in an ad-hoc solution (at least not error-free).",

We need programming systems that break out of the trinity, that feel alive and fluid and that move closer to the domains most people care about.",

It seems like the argument here is between abstractions that get general enough that they’re hard to specialize vs specialized tools that can’t get any reuse at all. \n\nIf we’re spending a lot of time reimplementing old stuff and\/or modifying general code to do what we *actually* want, then the main problem with general code is that it’s hard to *edit* (because of architecture, indirection, and (i’d argue) the impedance mismatch between text and structure editing.\n\nIt seems like a code editing tool that made it extremely easy to do the kind of refactoring we might need, like change something from json to xml, or a string to a list of strings might enable us to reuse specialized code by generating a new version of it specialized to a particular use case. that’s why i find stuff like the expressions of change project exciting: <https:\/\/www.expressionsofchange.org\/>",

The alternative, where I make a partial design that has concessions to the existing ways (like bottoming-out in text), and then iteratively broaden that design, saving self-hosting for the distant future, might be the only way I can make progress. Ultimately I'm not just making concessions to the built world around me, I'm making concessions to my own limited ability. That stings.\n\nOne wonders: Is it not sufficient to reinvent something bit by bit? Does it need to be a total design from the outset?\n\nI take your joke. It's funny!

In that sense it is like the original Negroponte Architecture Machine, which produced a prototype of Google Street view in 1970 when everyone was still on punchcards and terminals.  Unfortunately with today's technology the interaction model that users are offered is incredibly clumsy. The colored dots on their sheets of paper are basically a bar code, and not a well designed one at that, referring to code stored on a server. I think they would prefer to have MS' AR goggles, but that would take 100x the programming and at least 20x the budget. The realities of current programming make it effectively a lonely outpost in man-machine evolution.",

Certainly in smaller projects it holds true, and we'll see how close it gets on larger projects. Classical UML, and formal system design processes are not practical because you can't execute UML, so you end up with an implementation phase than then needs to be checked against a changing specification document; chaos ensues. Having the spec and the program be one thing should be grasped as a big win.",

If you watched Bret’s _Inventing on Principle_ and saw the polished demos, Dynamicland looks rough and not at all like what I was expecting.\n\nThankfully, I was able to have several great conversations with the researchers there. One thing that blew my mind is how pragmatic their approach to research is. Here we talk a lot about why one language or platform is better than another or how a certain architecture or implementation is better than another. There they picked Lua just because it was easy to integrate into the overall system, and did some performance tweaks to the camera recognition because the low frame rate was making some experiments difficult. For sure they’d love to use higher-resolution projectors and cameras, but it works well enough the way it does now and it’s more important to have more surface area equipped in the lab than show off a polished version but only have one table working.\n\nAt some point I blatantly voiced my expectation mismatch and Bret pointed out that this is not at all what Dynamicland is about. I had many questions about Realtalk and it’s claims and wishes system. They’re not building a programming language or system, that’s all just infrastructure to figure out what kinds of interactions work well in a setting where the room becomes the computer. They’d swap all the technology in a heartbeat, if there was a more pragmatic way to implement something (and as far as I can tell from what I remember they said during the tour, they did a few times already).\n\nIf you have the chance to go there, please do and please talk to them. Ask them about the vision and how they are trying to get there. If you’re just trying to understand how the current system works, you’re missing out on the most important parts of this research project. They’re not building technology. Okay, yes, they do a little bit. But that’s not the point.",

        "text": "Ah, found an old email… here’s how Bret phrased it back in 2017 (turns out I was a year off):\n&gt;We're currently using Lua and C interpreters for practical reasons.  Lua is a simple language with a simple interpreter that was designed to be easily integrated into a host system.  It's a lovely little imperative textual language for specifying the little bits of computation we print onto objects.  As we move forward, we're less interested in printing non-imperative textual languages onto objects, and more interested in specifying computation non-textually, using all the rich facilities of the real world.\n&gt;A core and unique feature of Realtalk is that a program can be literally any physical situation that can be seen by a camera.  From this perspective, debating this textual language vs that textual language suddenly looks rather provincial. ",

In those environments big money is spent on a requirements document which is typically fed to a system architecture\/design team which specializes in identifying in microscopic detail how the system is to operate, then passed to entirely separate team of implementors. The spec in that environment is supposed to completely specify WHAT  and WHEN the system accomplishes the task in excruciating detail, but not HOW, although nowadays screen mockups (some call them wireframes) are given and they have a fair amount of HOW in terms navigation and animation specified. The programmers are not tasked with any formulation of business logic or input or output formats. Those are supposed to be nailed down. My point is that if the cost of making the spec was 100 units of money, and the programming is 400 units, if you can use a notation for the spec that is executable maybe the total cost is 120 units. That would be a big savings in time and money. So many of the commercial practices use tools and methodologies that don't generate executable code. Certainly some of the prototyping tool companies are addressing this, but those things don't always work out so well.",

        "text": "But Ernest's point is very subtly reinforcing my position. If they spend so much on the spec, and it isn't executable, then that work is thrown away in the end, and worse yet, the spec inevitably diverges from the actual product built, and you get into tug-of-wars between the spec authors and the implementors as the implementors find all the flaws, missing pieces, and contradictions in the plan. This is a very similar situation to building architects and the actual builders. The builders often have a dim view of some architects because they create impractical situations that have to be fixed in the field. It would be better if you have a single source of truth. Redundancy is the largest source of error in computers IMHO.",
