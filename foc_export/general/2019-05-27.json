        "text": "I have been looking at IPFS recently and also came across the issue of devices with non-permanent network connections, for whatever reasons. My impression (which could be horribly wrong given how little I know about IPFS) is that this is considered an issue that software layers higher up in the stack should handle. IPFS does provide the required low-level support (pinning), but nothing for managing pinned content. A tool that does is IPFS Cluster, but it's for managing large pinned content collections spread over multiple servers. Another layer on top of IPFS that helps with this is [textile](<https:\/\/textile.io\/>), which adds PIM support to IPFS. And perhaps there is more stuff that I haven't found yet.",

You need a network of volunteers running \"cafés\" in order to provide the cloud servers needed to make it work, but that seems achievable in the context of a popular open source project. After all, Mastodon works; there are lots of Mastodon nodes to choose from. I think that part of the design is to consider what incentives there are for volunteers to run cloud nodes; what kinds of rewards do they get from contributing to the community in this way? I think that if cloud nodes are branded, if the volunteers get recognition for running a node, this might be important. If the cloud nodes are completely anonymous and invisible,  that might reduce the incentive to run a cloud node.",

For that reason, we see more rapid progress in text-based.\n\nBut a consequence of that is that visual-based programming ideas are under-explored, which is probably why this community is so excited about them.\n\nNot sure if \"it's harder and slower and more costly\" is a legitimate counter argument or a just a justification. In any case, I've planted my flag firmly in the \"visual languages are more fun\" camp so it's hard to come up with good devil's advocate arguments over the incessant neighing of my horse in this race.",

                "text": "(I have gripes that I need to get out of my system. I think that documenting my approach to a coding task could demonstrate some points I want to make, and help me give some ideas solid grounding.)\nMotivation\nExisting solutions for drawing graphics suffer from numerous technical, performance and usability flaws. (probably&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t bother to check.) But I want to be able to draw things using a computer. I have an itch, so to speak, and I&rsquo;m going to make a tool to scratch it.\nSo, I have decided to write a &ldquo;useful tool&rdquo; for building basic raster graphics. Like any &ldquo;useful tool&rdquo; worth its salt, it shall be designed for the environment of the 1970&rsquo;s teletype. Might I just remark, that we&nbsp;are so lucky that the pinnacle of human-computer interaction was reached so early on in computing. No other technological invention can boast of such rapid mastery!&nbsp;For the decades since, we&rsquo;ve been able to avoid wasting time on solved problems like &ldquo;how to use the new-fangled computing devices&rdquo;, letting us focus instead on what really matters&mdash;like writing &ldquo;useful tools&rdquo; to solve the&nbsp;real-world problems that we face&nbsp;right now.\nIt Must Have A Name\nBecause the tech of 1970, despite all its glory, made it undesirable to type very much, its name must be short and sweet. I&rsquo;ll call it: draw.\nWait, hmm, that looks odd. Verbose, perhaps. I don&rsquo;t want to be typing four characters every time I want to paint a pretty picture! Ah, I know, I have to use some inexplicable abbreviation&mdash;how about: drw. Yeah, that&rsquo;ll do it.\nOperation\nI&rsquo;m going to begin by considering how my life would be different after creating the drw&nbsp;utility. What do I want to happen? First of all, I am faced with a blank line of paper. (well, such was the case for my spiritual ancestors back in the &rsquo;70s; sadly we have to make do with simulated paper these days.) I feel like I might type:\n$ drw &gt; smiley.png\nWhat happens then? Interactive mode, I guess. I want to draw a simple smiley face, so probably start with something like&hellip;\n$ drw &gt; smiley.png\n# c 100 100 50\nThe c&nbsp;stands for &ldquo;circle&rdquo; (obviously). The first two numbers are the x- and y- co-ordinates of the centre (obviously), in pixels, from the top left-hand corner (duh). The third parameter is the radius expressed in pixels (what else?). Oh, and the #&nbsp;is the prompt for input. (it just felt like the right character to use.)\nHm, I should probably have that information easily accessible from the application itself. Here&rsquo;s what my printout should look like after requesting help:\n# h c\nc: circle\nUsage: c x y r\n#\nYeah, that should do it. I also realise something else I missed out. How is drw&nbsp;going to do anything without knowing the dimensions of the image? They should have been passed in at the start.\n$ drw -w 640 -h 480 &gt; smiley.png\n# c 100 100 50 % outline of the head\n# c 85 85 8    % left eye\n# c 115 85 8   % right eye\n# bz 85 215 100 230 115 215 % mouth\nOf course, any sensible language needs support for comments. This isn&rsquo;t some hacker system where obscurity is a&nbsp;goal; no, far from it. We must always remember that code is used by&nbsp;humans to communicate their intentions to the&nbsp;computer.\nCan you imagine how user-unfriendly&nbsp;computing would be, if we had to adapt ourselves to fit the machine instead of the other way round? Madness!\nNext, if I want curvy shapes like the mouth, then there ought to be a command for B&eacute;zier curves. The three pairs of co-ordinates are just the three control points for a quadratic curve. There could be an optional extra argument for a cubic or something.\n# h bz\nbz: Bezier curve\nUsage: bz x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 [x3 y3]\n#\nGreat. But one huge thing I forgot about: colours! Ah well, there can easily be defaults. Initially the background is black and the foreground is white, just like my beloved teletype emulator! &#10084;\nThen I should be able to send End-Of-File via Ctrl-D and see my picture in all its artistic brilliance!\n...\n# c 115 85 8   % right eye\n# bz 85 215 100 230 115 215 % mouth\n# ^D\nOutput written to stdout.\n$ pngvwr smiley.png\n\nHa! That&rsquo;s funny. The mouth is all the way down there? Come to think of it, the face only goes from y=50 to y=150 (assuming I did my mental maths correctly&mdash;such clerical work is inappropriate for a scientific instrument), so why the hell did I think 215 and 230 were a good idea? And the scale is way too small. I want to make some adjustments&hellip;\nDamn. I&rsquo;ll have to go back and enter all the commands again! But wait: I could just write them in a file and pipe that to stdin; I get scripting for free!&nbsp;Now that&rsquo;s the power of the command line. Can you imagine how cumbersome this stuff would be in a GUI? Or with pencil and paper? &#128578;\n$ cat smiley.drw\ns 2.5        % scale the coord sys by 2.5\nc 100 100 50 % outline of the head\nc 85 85 8    % left eye\nc 115 85 8   % right eye\nbz 85 115 100 130 115 115 % mouth&nbsp;(fixed!)\nCommands to alter the coordinate system would be useful too. At minimum, scale, rotate, translate. (I was going to use r&nbsp;for rectangle, but I still have capital R!)\n$ drw -w 640 -h 480  smiley.png\nOutput written to stdout.\n$ ls\nsmiley.drw  smiley.png\n$ pngvwr smiley.png\nAnd so, TikZ is born.\nRight, that&rsquo;s enough design for now. The next installments will use the coding of drw&nbsp;as a springboard for concrete demonstrations of some ideas. And of course, more &ldquo;features&rdquo; will be tacked on as they come up. But regardless of how far this goes, some things are guaranteed:\nThere will never be immediate feedback between creator and creation. The &ldquo;spec&rdquo; for the picture is written and compiled, and the result &ldquo;viewed&rdquo;, in separate, batch-mode stages; completely unlike &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; in any sense of the word.\nThe program will be its own little untouchable universe. Functionality can only be added during the &ldquo;fabrication process&rdquo; of the next version. It will be as brittle as pottery.\nWorst of all, fundamentally visual concepts like position, size, shape, colour, angle etc. will remain brutally stuffed into the Language Box. The whole point of such a command-line utility is to use a thousand words to describe a picture. How is this anything other than outrageous?\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

For example, we spent multiple meetings going Jonathan Edwards list of IDE's and programming environments throughout history.  That was a surprisingly fertile locus for discussion.  Expect things to start small (in the beginning it was often just me and one other person) but it will grow.",

It suggests that a program about making sound is better programmed by.. playing an instrument? The logic breaks down pretty quickly when you start looking at more wild examples.\n\nIt puts visual languages into a box that they never seem to grow out of — \"Sure, they're good when you're working with visual stuff — artsy stuff — but they aren't good when making an [ETL pipeline \/ SaaS app \/ PoS terminal \/ etc].\" I think this is a bit of No True Scotsman.\n\nI'd argue that the reason many visual programming languages are made for artistic uses is not because VPLs are well suited to graphics, but rather because there's some classism going on — \"real\" text programming for real programmers, and \"that VPL stuff\" for non-programmers.\n\nAfter all, one of the richest VPLs is Max\/MSP — a tool primarily for working with sound, not imagery.\n\n----\n\nOther than that one line, I agree with everything else you said, and I know that in general we're on the same page about all this stuff.

(Don't look for this on github: the project was too ambitious to implement.) I decided that the Unix decision to represent most data as ASCII text is holding us back. My replacement was a variant on S-expressions, called T-code, which was hierarchical, and could encode anything: documents, source code, databases, images, etc. Instead of a file system, your hard drive is formatted as a T-Code store. Network protocols would be serialized T-Code, etc. The JavaScript Binary AST reminded me of this old idea.\n\nBecause Curv represents source code as Unix files and directories, image literals are restricted by the syntax to only appear as initializers for record fields. If I could use T-Code instead to encode source code, then this limitation would disappear, and image literals could appear in any subexpression.",

That was an immediate red flag for me.\n\nThe actual programming features they're building are, well...\n• a slightly nicer UX (eg: animated preview thumbnails) for the \"Behaviours\" from Director and Flash\n• a slightly nicer UX (eg: live editing) for the \"triggers\" of GameMaker \/ RPGMaker \/ StarEdit \/ Fear &amp; Loathing \/ every game builder tool.\n• and then you bottom out in a pretty gnarled scripting language in a tiny little feature poor editor window.\n\nWhat I found most disheartening, though, were all the \"hyper-causal\" games being demoed and discussed, and the implication that this tool is your ticket to the top of the app store. I don't mind casual games, but these all seemed woefully unpolished... almost mass-manufactured. Like a resurgence of shovelware. Call me a snob, but I like my games — from <http:\/\/itch.io|itch.io> to AAA — to be finely crafted. I didn't see passion for games anywhere in this video — I just saw passion for the games market.",

The only novelty I saw was in the semantics (as far as I could tell) of their node language: not data-flow, not a state machine, not a flowchart.  Instead it looks like you start at the initial point on each behavior iteration and walk down the DAG.  (So a little bit like Max Cycling though Max is probably best thought of as a bunch of objects that send with gray wires as pathways where symbolic messages might be could be sent and dashed wires for more continuous data-flowish signals.)  Moreover, the whole system looks to suffer from the common problem of hidden data and state, which naturally leads to the what-the-hell-is-going-on so endemic to programming.",
