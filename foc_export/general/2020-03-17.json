Many of them are technical, and many of them are political (in the sense of \"principles related to power or status\"). The technical reasons are where this community tends to spend most of its energy. But there are a lot of people out there who are interested in both, or are more interested in the political reasons, and have a different perspective on what the future of programming looks like. I've seen many cases where those people are excluded from discussions or communities because their interests are \"off-topic\". I wanted to make it clear that these discussions are explicitly on-topic here. They're welcome in <#C5T9GPWFL|general>, or in new channels if new popular topics emerge. I'd love to see us explore the relationship between wealth (I put this first because it's exactly the point you raised!), race, gender, education, language, ability, or age, and influence on the evolution of computing.

I'd love to continue revising the CoC based on feedback like this, fine-tuning the message. In time, I will probably do just that (and if I do, I will come back to this thread for reference). But I've already put many (many) hours into researching and writing this CoC, and I've got a backlog of other things to do for this community, so I'm feeling too time-constrained to pursue a big rephrasing right now.
