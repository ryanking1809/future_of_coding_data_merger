Are you just regenerating them when the model changes and wipe all the data in the downstream systems, or have you thought about migrations to keep the data in those systems and adapt the schemas (a decade ago when I was doing Ruby that was a hot thing in Ruby on Rails with Active Record; I assume that's still around but probably not that special anymore…).",

Most of the FP\/immutable approaches assume that every change is defined at exactly one point in the program, and that multiple such changes are globally single-threaded via some external magic. Ignores the hard problem of combining changes across space and time. Imperative programming lets you do whatever you want by manually ordering everything, which is impractically complicated. Neither approach is an acceptable solution.",
