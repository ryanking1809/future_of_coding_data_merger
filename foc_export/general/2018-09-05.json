Pure functions -- not necessary. I think it's fine to keep pure functions as text for now and keep them as node content. This clicks with idea of splitting program into two languages living separate worlds: <https:\/\/twitter.com\/vladimir_vg\/status\/1035422044605829120>\n\n2) I like Erlang model of isolated processes and messages, and feels like something similar would be expressed in this graph code quite good.\n\n3) The actual execution might be also saved into graph, linked with code nodes. Imagine that you pick function or process and immediately see connections to different inputs from past. If we capture all IO into graph, then we may play out execution of the whole program.\n\n4) This programming environment surely gonna work with graphs, match against them. How matching against graph gonna look like in this graph language? Maybe this is the key to structure of code, clear analogy with Lisp and it's code as list.",

My opinion is that we should have graphs as first-class citizen everywhere, period. But you could have different representations where some can be textual and great variety between general &lt;-&gt; domain specific.\n\nUgly demo I made quickly ~year ago which express the idea of multi-representation (check video)\n<https:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/log#niko-autios-microeditor>\n\nOn the other hand core idea that you have different DSL \/ domain representation \/ dialect for these two use cases is more appealing for research.",

On the other hand, elm-format is loved tool in their community which is a tool built precisely for removing user formatting so it can be considered a feature.\n\nJust as F# compiler want's files to be ordered and code can call only previous one. It sounds tedious at first but after a little while, it's a nice feature which makes reasoning about dependencies much easier.",
