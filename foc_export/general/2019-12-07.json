        "text": "<@UF89Z7SRF> I can see where our understanding of _abstraction_ diverges. Most of the examples you gave, I would call _translations_ or _transformations_, because you jump between domains. I agree that _transformations_ don’t necessarily remove or add details. My understanding of _transformation_ is that it’s merely a change of form or appearance.\n\nMy understanding of _abstraction_ is that it is a more specific form of _translation_, with the added constraints of what I described as “removing detail” and also that you stay within the same domain.\n\nYou abstract because you generalize more specific concepts by ignoring some of their details and lift the commonalities you want to highlight into a concept that’s higher up the taxonomy, still in the same domain. You do that so you can remove complexity and more efficiently think or communicate with the now abstracted, simpler concept, no longer having to deal with all the detail removed. For me that’s the whole point of abstracting — to reduce cognitive burden, to simplify.\n\nIn my taxonomy of definitions, confusingly _abstraction_ is therefore a more specific concept than _transformation_ adding more specific requirements to what it describes.\n\nThat’s how I think about this.\nDoes that make any sense?",
