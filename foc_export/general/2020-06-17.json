(Part of) the essence of spreadsheet's success is duplicating the best features of an already existing paper technology. To judge Loglo, I would look at artist sketchbooks.

Requiring all of the sketches to fit into equal size cells on a regular grid seems like a limitation of Loglos. I think you'd want to organize the sketches on a 2D canvas, and allow for different intermediate forms to have different sizes, depending on their importance and internal complexity.\n\nLoglo shows you a series of intermediate forms generated by applying successive operations in a pipeline. That's valuable, but I would also want the ability to display a collection of forms generated by the same function with different parameter values.",
