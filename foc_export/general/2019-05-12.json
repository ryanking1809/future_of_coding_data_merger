        "text": "I would think that \"emergent\" behavior is behavior that emerges (i.e. is discovered or evolves naturally) from patterns of interaction\/use with parts of a system. Anything that is just the expected way the entire system must behave (even if it's a distributed system) is not really \"emergent\".\n\nI usually hear others talk about \"emergence\" as if it's a \"divide and conquer\" approach to whole system design. I think that's a bad technique in general, because you want your software to be as whole and consistent and possible. (Even with hard boundaries across machines, the impact of that split can be minimized).\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure that's not the OOP vision of \"emergence\" that Alan Kay promotes. That's more like \"here's some crayons and a canvas\" or \"here's some forces that can be applied to objects\", and seeing where that leads to.",
