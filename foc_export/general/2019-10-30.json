        "text": "I'm not sure this is relevant but my background in memory constrained apps with lots of data means that macros have to happen at build time not runtime. An example macro might get the size of N files, take tha max size of those sizes, and check that that size is under some specified max size, then use the size of the largest file to statically allocate a specifically sized piece of memory. There is no memory free to include any of this logic at runtime nor could it be done at runtime since if maxsize(files) &gt; maxSizeAvailale the program will crash. That's something we need to catch at build time and fix the files (take out some data, simplifiy something, etc..). And, even if it could be done at runtime it would be a bad user experience waiting for the system to get the max size of N files adding to the wait time for the app to start.\n\nSo at one level I agree it's code transformation all the way down but each transformation stage has a purpose.",

            "text": "It is amusing to me that his laptop has an Erlang sticker, when Joe Armstrong, the inventor had such a dim view of the Actor model. There is a lively reunion on YouTube of three famous senior UK computer scientists who each selected a different technology to pursue. One was Hewitt, the actor model, and Armstrong, and Hoare who had some other paradigm i forget which. Anyway they had a debate about what were the results, and Armstrong ripped them to shreds because he pointed out that is system worked and theirs didn't actually work. Pharo has the best IDE i have ever seen, but the underlying language smalltalk was DOA (dead on arrival). The original editions of the smalltalk book by Goldberg are worth a lot, because sensible people like me who bought that book tossed it out because the language is so clunky and hard to read, and frankly absurd. You send the message PLUS to the number 3 along with another operator 2, and then the 3 updates itself to 5. That isn't too far out, but when you get to bitmap manipulation, the model really gets ugly.\n\n The actor model creates not only huge numbers of little islands of state, but then compounds that mistake by creating a message passing system that is hell to debug. In any toolchain that becomes hypercomplex to understand, there are always exceptional people who claim it is no problem, but if you take a big actor model program, and pass it to another programmer, they will have zero chance of understanding it. It becomes a nightmare of dependencies and cross-connections, just like the human body.\n\nI only make these possibly inflammatory remarks to warn people to look up Armstrong's talk, and think twice about wasting your time on a model that has such a legacy of failure.    If someone would like to debate this with me, we can have Steve Krouse act as referee, and hold a fire extinguisher nearby so when you burst into flames you won't be permanently harmed ;-&gt;",

        "text": "<@ULM3U6275>’s comment is spot on. Externally, when you send a message to an Erlang process you don't know what 'version' it's at. So it looks like this mutable bundle of state you're interacting with. This is very similar to any other actor model. The only thing is a process has more control of when it accepts new messages and can do so when it has reached a consistent state.\n\nHere's an interesting comment from Joe Armstrong:\n&gt; Then, my thesis supervisor said \"But you're wrong, Erlang is extremely object oriented\". He said object oriented languages aren't object oriented. I might think, though I'm not quite sure if I believe this or not, but Erlang might be the only object oriented language because the 3 tenets of object oriented programming are that it's based on message passing, that you have isolation between objects and have polymorphism.\n\nSource: <https:\/\/www.infoq.com\/interviews\/johnson-armstrong-oop\/>",

        "text": "In the talk above the Hoare and Hewitt are somewhat smug, and Armstrong upbraids them because he points out his system actually built shipping products that worked well. Their approaches did not work.  It is easy to lump Erlang\/Elixir into a category with other languages, but it is a unique beast; with a very clever runtime that creates a stack and heap for each micro-process. This allows you to reboot a process, and not have some godawful pile of a million tiny chunks of memory that have to be marked and swept. When it comes to massive multithreading, there is only two ways to do it: a super meticulously hand-crafted runtime, or use the runtime that Erlang\/Elixir have, because it solves an immensely difficult problem.\n\nIf you take the straight actor model, and combine non-reversibility with  concurrency, your system will be incredibly fragile. That is Armstrong's point. He wasn't a theoretician like Hewitt and Hoare, but someone building real high volume things, not toys.",

        "text": "Armstrong has a lot of good videos up. They are entertaining and informative. One thing to remember though is that Erlang was banned inside Ericsson, where it was created, and that banning is probably related to the poor transferability score that Erlang possesses. If you notice that Elixir is having much greater acceptance, because some would describe the Erlang syntax as opaque. A program in commercial use lasts decades, and the ability to transfer code from one person to the next is a major factor in language selection. This means sticking with popular languages, but also avoiding ones like LISP, FORTH, and APL which have super low transferability.  It would be great to hear from people who used to work at Ericsson as to why exactly it was banned. There was no question that his system worked well, and was robust; but maybe it was too hard to maintain and thus fragile in the end? There is a lot of information in failure, and i wish people would be more honest about the failures of the past; this is how you get wisdom.",

                "text": "The Croquet Project was a software project intended to promote the continued development of the Croquet open-source software development kit to create and deliver collaborative multi-user online applications.\nImplemented in Squeak Smalltalk, Croquet supports communication, collaboration, resource sharing, and synchronous computation among multiple users. Applications created with the Croquet software development kit (SDK) can be used to support highly scalable collaborative data visualization, virtual learning and problem solving environments, 3D wikis, online gaming environments (massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)), and privately maintained or interconnected multiuser virtual environments.\nSince release of the Croquet SDK in 2007, the SDK has not been under active development. All further development of the technology has occurred under the Open Cobalt effort.",

        "text": "Companies like Autodesk which uses Autolisp as the core language of their system (the only  large company i am aware of basing their technology on LISP) doesn't care if their language is popular. It is their secret weapon and makes AutoCad infinitely programmable. My question remains, what were the technical factors behind the decision to ban Erlang? Plenty of companies use a custom-made secret sauce to generate their products (Facebook uses Hack for front end if i am not mistaken, a derivative of PHP). When you dominate a sector using your tools, why would you ban the tool? Ericsson was kicking butt back in 1998, and still is a top-3 player in Telecom infrastructure equipment. So little information leaks out of companies about why things did or did not pan out. We usually have to wait 20 years or more to find out the true story.",

        "text": "croquet is very fast, and simple. However, if the relay server has no state whatsoever, this means that you can have conflicts between shared resources. Most multiplayer games i am aware of, have a server which is stateful, and enforces various rules, and dishes out exclusive resources, and arbitrates between the clients. Handling latency effects gracefully is an art form, and there are surprisingly few programmers who have built the networking stacks for various games. It is a super-narrow specialty of the programming industry, those people who know the networking aspects very well. Making sure that lower latency doesn't give you too much of an advantage is a very subtle area for which i have the highest admiration. I sure hope they have good debugging tools; it is no easy thing to debug multiple computers running in parallel at a distance, with lag times, and retransmissions causing random fluctuations in arrival time of correct packets.",
