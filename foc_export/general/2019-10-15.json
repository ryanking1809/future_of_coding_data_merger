I'm not familiar with Pypy, but I've seen several OSs chase POSIX-compatibility, starting with OpenBSD. Nobody cares. Inevitably they aren't 100% compatible on the axes people care about, and 99.9% compatibility yields 0.1% adoption. (OpenBSD usage is all by people who live exclusively in OpenBSD.)\n\nAnd people are right. They're being rational. They're following the design rule that similar things should look similar and different things should look different. If it looks similar but is different under the hood it's in an uncanny valley. It takes a _lot_ to build trust in it.\n\nIf you're building something new today, stop trying to support existing software. It's a long, thankless death-march, and will never get you the adoption you want. Take the leap and let it be its own unique thing, without constraining it with the past.\n\nNew projects take 10 years (full time) to gain adoption. Stop trying to find shortcuts.",

I've been saying this for a long time: there are obviously use cases for OSes that do this, and POSIX exists for a reason, but POSIX-compliance shouldn't be considered the first step of building a new OS. If it eventually becomes something you NEED to have, build it as an extension, like Plan9 did. You might not be able to support the entire spec, but it will get you 90% of the way there which is good enough for most applications. Why should exploration of the OS space be constrained by \"compatibility\" dogma?",

        "text": "Douglas Crockford's issue is that you can't safely use binary floating point for financial calculations, you should use decimal FP instead. See &lt;http:\/\/dec64.com\/&gt;. Crockford claims that his DEC64 format is more efficient than IEEE Decimal floating point. He also proposes that DEC64 should be \"the only number type in the next generation of application programming languages\". That makes sense for spreadsheets, and languages used for financial calculations, but not for everything. No need to wait 20 years, DEC64 is available now on github.\n\nDEC64 is a terrible idea for things like Machine Learning, and 3D graphics (both of which use GPUs). DEC64 would be a bad choice for my project, Curv, which is an end-user programming language for 3D graphics. For these applications, you need efficient binary floating point. IEEE binary floating point is an improvement over the non-IEEE floats found in some older GPU hardware: it has better numerical properties. What might be even better than IEEE FP, for ML and 3D, is \"posit\" floating point. For a given number of bits, it uses those bits more efficiently and represents a larger range of numbers which are distributed in a more effective way along the number line. Also, IMO, posit arithmetic has better numeric properties than IEEE. &lt;https:\/\/posithub.org\/docs\/BeatingFloatingPoint.pdf&gt;. Posits are *not* a drop in replacement for IEEE float (your code may need to change), and they aren't competitive unless implemented in hardware (unlike DEC64), so we may be waiting a while. They make the most sense for new ML hardware being built.\n\nFor a language like Idris, where you use dependent types to prove programs correct, you need a natural number type, Nat, which implements the Peano axioms directly. You need this so that you can perform inductive proofs over the natural numbers. You need other numeric types as well (Nat doesn't include negative numbers or fractions).\n\nIn systems languages like C, C++ and Rust, you need multiple numeric types like int8, int16, int32 and int64, so that you can write high performance code that optimizes memory consumption and memory access patterns and uses the L1 cache efficiently. Systems programming is not \"a hangover from the 70's\".\n\nIf you want to design a programming language that has only a single numeric type, and is competitive in all of these niches, then I have bad news for you.",

I also mean compete for usefulness in achieving your goal. For example, let’s say your end goal isn’t primarily testing an experimental language design, but rather to build a FoC development environment. Then you have to ask if your custom language is really the best base to build it on. If JS supports enough of the high level features you feel you need to build your development environment in, then you have to ask how your own language would compete for accomplishing the goal of building your development environment (regardless of whether or not you care about your development environment’s adoption).",

        "text": "What numeric types should your wide-spectrum, all-domain FoC language support?\n\nDouglas Crockford &lt;http:\/\/dec64.com\/&gt; claims that decimal floating point (his DEC64 data type) should be \"the only number type in the next generation of application programming languages\". Binary floating point is unsafe for financial calculations, so DEC64 is a good choice for spreadsheets or any language that does financial calculations. But Crockford also says DEC64 is \"well suited to most scientific applications\", and that's less clear.\n\nI do agree that for an end-user programming language focused on a specific domain, the simplicity of a single numeric type is valuable. And DEC64 is a good choice *if* the domain involves finance. For my language Curv, a DSL for 3D graphics, the best choice is IEEE binary floating point as the single numeric type.\n\nFor scientific computation, the popular choice is a batteries-included language with all the features needed by experts. Experts also need speed, because some scientific computations take a long time to run. That means you need vectorized IEEE binary floating point. Nobody will ever port BLAS and LAPACK to DEC64. Ditto for Machine Learning and 3D Graphics (which run on a GPU): you need vectorized binary floating point, because that's what the hardware supports.\n\nFor a functional language like Idris, where you use dependent types to prove programs correct, you need a natural number type, Nat, which implements the Peano axioms directly. In the Idris standard library, `data Nat = Z | S Nat`. You need this so that you can perform inductive proofs over the natural numbers. You need other numeric types as well (Nat doesn't include negative numbers or fractions).\n\nIn systems languages like C, C++ and Rust, you need the full set of numeric types supported by the hardware, including int8, int16, int32 and int64, so that you can write high performance code that optimizes memory consumption and memory access patterns and uses the L1 cache efficiently.\n\nA true wide spectrum language would presumably need to support all of these different kinds of numeric computation, and in each case, do as good a job as more specialized languages designed by domain experts. And that would make the language much more complicated than a domain specific language. For any given task, a DSL is probably a better choice.",

I can buy used Supermicro or Dell servers for a few hundred that are only a few years old and costs thousands before. We are awash in CPU power today, but human skill is hard to get a hold of (and retain!). So really the future of computing is about making things easier for humans, not faster for the computer.",

        "text": "Well, we are living in a present where one language+toolchain dominates in the web (the HTML\/CSS\/JS\/framework), because the monopoly of browser manufacturers agreed among themselves to only allow this language. As Web Assembler creeps into the mix, this monopoly is going to end, hence the intense energy to prepare for that opening. In the back end of servers, it is save to say that PHP and Java have dominated the past, and those two are vulnerable. So there is an intense battle for the back end as well. And then there are specialty markets like  ML, VR, 3D gaming, where intense battles rage. Of course no one single language will dominate all these areas, but in a given area, absolutely history shows that people coalesce to at least a 70% level around a language. It started with FORTRAN, then it was COBOL, and then Java (the COBOL of our time), then JS on the web, and in the future who knows. It certainly won't be Java or PHP on the backend, and it won't be JS in the web either. The existing tools are very costly, and with millions of new programmers coming into the field over the next 5 years per some estimates, the existing toolchains represent an arcane, ridiculously frustrating environment. The joke in the TV business was NTSC which is the US' analog tv standard meant never twice the same color, and i wish someone would come up with a cute name for CSS, which is one of the most frustrating languages ever devised. The tiniest error can cause your page to distort in a completely unpredictable manner, and people expect that to be the only way to go for the foreseeable future?  Frustration = manhours wasted, and human costs have to be minimized, otherwise the industry will just outsource.",
