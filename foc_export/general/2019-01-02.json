        "text": "In the Granger talk there were comments about how industry and academia are coming together. I don't see anything useful for simplicity coming out of academia or the slightest bit of cooperation in terms of practical language development. The brilliant work of Prof N. Wirth of ETH has been dumped onto the ash-heap of history.  His stuff was real simple compared to anything else of the time. Academia is busy using R, or playing around with Coq and similar tools which is not a practical tool for general purpose programming. The obsession with proving programs correct is a mostly pointless exercise, as you can't even prove TicTacToe correct using that system, because it doesn't have concept of drawing. Hardly anyone is doing raw computation now, it is 99% about interactive graphics as expressed as websites, IOS\/Android Apps, etc. I wish academia was making the next generation of tools for us to use, with their tens of billions in funding that collectively they have each year, but alas i can't think of a useful project originating from academia in a long time. All the action i see is around what Google is doing, or Amazon with AWS, Apple with Swift, or what JetBrains is doing with their now dominant IDE. By my estimates, Academia is using far more closed-source, monthly-subscription software than private companies, tools like ArcGIS, R, Mathematica, Adobe Creative Suite, are all dirt cheap for students, but quite expensive for post-students, and that is the business model, of capturing academics with really nice packaged software that they will end up licensing as they graduate into companies. I see a bizarro world now, where academia is entrenched in commercial tools, and industry is going more open source and doing the R&amp;D at their own expense, and ignoring the academic output for the most part. I think the universities are so fat now, they are like the pentagon; with deans flying around in private jets, pulling 7 figures. And i don't see the serfs known as graduate students empowered to do big enough projects to make a toolchain.",

While you’re writing about novice users, I think a shared space is valuable for experts too. I’m thinking of something like VSCode live share (<https:\/\/code.visualstudio.com\/blogs\/2017\/11\/15\/live-share>) which tries to provide a Google docs-like editing experience. My hunch is this is an underexplored space (its still pretty much the exact same textual experience, just with another person in there). But I’m not sure what a more advanced version would look like!",
