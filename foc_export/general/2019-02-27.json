Even now most of coding is a combination of visual and structural (almost always represented as visual) - the code is text, and the file system is structural.\n\nI don't think we'll be getting rid of text in code anytime soon. I don't think we should. Perhaps eventually, yes, since what text in code does is describe structures of logic - but right now text markup is a powerful interface for doing that. It would require coming up with a similarly powerful representation that allows for similarly powerful manipulation of the structure.\n\n(When I talk about powerful, I mean how accessible it is for human thought, in addition to how fast it is for humans to manipulate.)\n\nThe far future of coding might not be textual, though. And I think there will be growing amount of visual assistance for the structure of code, and the text-based parts of code will reduce to smaller fragments while the structure takes more priority.",

        "text": "You’re right, <@UC6997THT>, I don’t know if there's hard data about what’s easier to learn, gestures or keyboard shortcuts. \n\nI was basing my assumption on gestures being more aligned with some of the metaphorical structures we use in natural language (e.g. “stock market is up”, “up” is metaphorically structured to mean “more” or “positive”; that's hopelessly oversimplified, see Lakoff's work for details).\n\nGestures can have direction and physicality (also talked about in the video I linked to above). This I believe to encourage intuitive understanding, because it is tapping into some very deeply embedded metaphors that we use all the time in language and which are based on how we interact with the world (think of how much in language is structured with e.g. spatial direction, “stock market up”, “feeling down”, “going back in time”, “moving forward with a decision”, etc.).\n\nHowever, how well that works, might also be dependent on how we acquire that skill, much like language itself. I have spend almost seven years officially (and many more before and after that) in that world of Apple's user interface design and experience principles, and for me a lot of these gestures just make sense on a very intuitive level with not much cognitive effort involved. I find it much harder to memorize the right chords of keys to press for more advanced keyboard shortcuts. The ones I do use all the time, are “muscle memory”, as in I wouldn’t be able to tell you the keys without watching my fingers — and isn’t that also a gesture? \n\nSo from that I was following that gestures are on a somewhat lower level, where there is less cognitive effort involved. Of course, assuming that the metaphors used for gestures are aligned with metaphors we use in natural language, for which pinch-to-zoom seems to be an excellent example for instance.",

I'll just point out a couple landmines I hope you'll avoid in terms of what I imagine the reaction will be, as we stepped on them a few times with Eve.\n\nThe first is you spend a lot of time correctly pointing out the things that are wrong with the way things work today. This gets people who are invested in the way things work today defensive. They'll rightly point out that Dark doesn't fully exist yet, so you can't defend your claims, and they'll point to things like Eve to say you're next in a long line of failed projects, and they won't be wrong.\n\nThe second thing I think you need to answer in your piece is this, because it's going to be one of the first things people bring up. You talk about how Dark will solve a bunch of problems if you do your work in the Dark ecosystem. That's great, but that raises the specter of lockin. You've gotta answer questions like: how does Dark fit into my existing ecosystem, is it open source, and is it free.\n\nThird, the article is a bit of a tease. I think that's what you're going for, so that's okay, but it does leave one without a sense of really understanding what Dark is. Without something to show, that's difficult to overcome. So my questions for you is, what do you hope to get out of this post? Is it for people to join your mailing list and follow you on Twitter? Is it to just get some buzz going? Is it just a kind of manifesto?\n\nAll in all, a great post, I think it will get some buzz on HN and other outlets, but I warn you to be prepared for some incredulous bickering that comes with the territory.",
