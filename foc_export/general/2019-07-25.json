        "text": "My point about TodoMVC is that if you rely on the OS standard library too heavily in your test cases, you are really testing the OS not the language on top of it. One typically does not handle all the myriad complexities that are inside a text edit box. One gets a lot more information about the merits of a language when you code a more complex project like the chess program i mentioned.\n\nIn the Mythical Man Month book, Prof. Brooks mentions that coding speed is relatively constant in terms of lines per day, so a more concise language is indeed more productive. He did not state any data about errors per line, but noted that overall productivity in terms of lines per code finished per day was remarkably constant. So conciseness is a major virtue as it also delivers more cost effectiveness.\n\nThe virtues of conciseness was demonstrated in the switch from Assembler in OS\/360 and the transition to PL1 in the Multics OS. PL\/1 was unfortunately shunned by the other mainframe companies for competitive reasons, and thus COBOL was enthroned, beating out the other contender FORTRAN, but PL\/1 was much more concise and productive than COBOL. But the most productive and effective language has never been adopted as the standard by the programming community, which overall pursues maximal billable hours rather than maximum cost effectiveness. This is how Java become #1 in enterprise coding. The staffers wanted the most verbose, most ponderous and spaghetti-capable language available.\n\nThose of us rebels who like to work in less popular languages purely for productivity gains of small teams, will always be aware of nice languages that are overlooked.",

Basically, the APIs that expose browser functionality to your code. Those APIs are designed around JS semantics, so there's probably no escaping some dissonance if you're trying to run a very pure, safe language inside WASM but still actually make something that people can use.\n\n(Yes, this is not that different from running a pure, safe language on top of any other platform designed for C or POSIX or what have you.)",

I.e., today usually designers create a static mock-up and hand it off to a developer to implement, but why can't the designer's design tool just output something usable that doesn't need a developer to \"translate\" it?\n\nHere are some recent tools that try to solve this problem:\n\n- Webflow <https:\/\/webflow.com>\n- Framer X <https:\/\/www.framer.com\/>\n\nHere are some older tools that try to solve this problem:\n\n- Interface Builder <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interface_Builder>\n- DreamWeaver <https:\/\/adobe.com\/products\/dreamweaver>\n- Quartz Composer <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quartz_Composer>\n- Origami Studio <https:\/\/origami.design\/>\n\nAre there other important ones I'm missing?\n\nInterface Builder dates from 1988, the same year as Adobe Photoshop, so we've had a long time to work on this problem, but I wouldn't say any of these tools have been very successful. What makes this problem so difficult? Are there tools that tried to do this before Interface Builder and DreamWeaver? How did they fare?\n\nWhat's the most successful piece of software to ever try to do this? I'd say it's a toss-up between DreamWeaver and Interface Builder, is there anything more successful I'm missing?",

You want to use a tool like DreamWeaver, or Photoshop, or Blender, or Premiere Pro, or … in the UI provided, but you also want to capture some abstract constraints and formulas between objects in your scene. “These two divs should be centered and spaced 25% apart, and have the same width” “The nav should have the same color as the footer.”\n\nHowever, direct manipulation tools rarely give you the way to express these constraints or formulas, since that would be complicated, and require visualizing a program to users in an intuitive way. It suffers from the same problems that visual programming languages more generally (paging the expert <@UC2A2ARPT>). Work in the PL community has started to approach this problem of “prodirect manipulation”, specifically Ravi Chugh and co: <https:\/\/ravichugh.github.io\/sketch-n-sketch\/>",

        "text": "This is a very interesting topic, very close to my heart. My own Beads project is about creating an executable specification language. The basic concept is a language so concise and precise that it is the replacement for a purely descriptive document, and since it handles autosizing well, it forms the specification of how the layouts change with different orientations and sizes. Apple's SwiftUI does similar things, however, Beads is platform independent (Desktop, Mobile, Web) and not part of Apple's walled garden.  However, Beads doesn't have a fancy graphical aid helper modules yet, and so far in my interviews with designers, the majority of them don't want to consider all the fine details that programmers must consider. So i think for a very long time, no matter how nice the tools get for developers, the handoff problem will continue. I do believe that in the future using \"executable spec\" types of tooling, that the designer and programmer will work more closely together instead of sequentially, as the final product can be built in one step instead of 2; the designer can do the layouts, prep the art, and the programmer can inject that into the business and screen logic, and produce a product in record time.",

All of these jobs used to be done by traditional programmers working closely with traditional artists, and then the programmers created specialized tools, and the artists forged these new skills so that they could apply their artistic ability directly to that domain using these new tools.\n\nThe same thing happened with indie games (Unity, Unreal, GameMaker), and electronic music (Max\/MSP, Ableton Live, even modular synthesis), and not least of all — spreadsheets!\n\nWe often talk about making tools that allow people to use a computer \"without learning to code\". But the existing successful cases of that, to me, appear to be the cases where programmers made tools that required non-programmers to learn a freshly-invented skill — a skill that ends up being less foreign than programming, a skill designed to be similar to their existing skillset, but an all new skill nonetheless.\n\nSo (back to Edward's point) I do see a bright future for bringing the designer and the programmer closer together — by making tools that allow the designer, after learning a few new complementary skills, to do things themselves that they previously relied on the programmer to do.",
