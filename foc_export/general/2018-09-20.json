        "text": "Hey all, you may remember me from the podcast earlier this year (<https:\/\/omny.fm\/shows\/future-of-coding\/2-1-building-for-developers-aidan-cunniffe>). I just finished taking Optic (<http:\/\/useoptic.com|useoptic.com>) through YC's summer batch and with help from PG &amp; the partners we raised a seed round.\n\nWe've built a powerful two-way code generator that can help teams write and maintain the boilerplate, glue code and tests in their projects. We handle all the routine programming so developers can focus on the most important\/novel code. Unlike traditional code generators Optic is smart enough to work even if you make manual changes to generated code. This has enabled a lot of really interesting use cases over the summer (<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=17560059>) and we're excited to build an awesome product \/ company around the most promising. I think we're taking a very pragmatic approach to this problem that acknowledges most companies aren't going to throw out existing code to use a new programming environment.\n\nRight now Optic is just me and I'm looking for someone to build the next chapter of the company with. If you're passionate about improving programming that checks the most important box. Some combination of writing parsers, developing programming languages\/tools, and product management chops are nice to haves. If you or someone you know would be interested in working on a problem like this full time, feel free to reach out :slightly_smiling_face:. Thanks all for your support \/ feedback over the last few months.",

Aidan and I discuss the trade-offs between creating tools for developers vs non-programmers. We also get to hear some of the upcomming features to expect from Optic. We finish off the interview with a fun theoretical discussion of notation, representation, conciseness and learnability. <http:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/episodes\/21>",
