        "text": "I'm just going to spill some thoughts here:\n\nThere are multiple aspects to making programming more comprehensible, or perhaps even properly doable in the first place.\n\nThe first obvious one is language. But even if you could have the perfect language, textual code is not the best for comprehending and manipulating complex models.\n\nSo then there's presentation &amp; modeling: perhaps some things are much better represented in a visually, or much easier to edit or build if working with a direct structure (rather than a typed out one). But if your program-flow is a mess or the abstractions are bad, then it's going to be hard to follow regardless.\n\nSo then there's the actual form of the program itself: does it lay out what it is and what it does in a fairly straightforward and obvious way? How big of a gap is there between a human understanding of the software, and how it reads? Do you have to reverse engineer the code to make sense of it?\n\nAll these things are essential: the presence of one cannot compensate for the absence of the other. For example, you can have a horrible mess of code, but that horrible mess can be diagrammed in a way that makes the exact nature \/ layout of that horrible mess immediately obvious. And having the flow and components of a program be obvious at a glance, does not mean that that flow itself is not convoluted and hard to follow in it's own rite. And likewise, a mass of textual code may do a horrible job of making a program easy to understand by looking at it, but the components and flow of the program may be laid out well and very easy to follow.\n\nI have a couple points about this, but I'll have to save it for a follow-up post",

        "text": "A Guardian interview with some valuable thoughts from the programmer\/engineer who lead the software teams for NASA’s Apollo missions, Margaret Hamilton:\n<https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2019\/jul\/13\/margaret-hamilton-computer-scientist-interview-software-apollo-missions-1969-moon-landing-nasa-women>\n\n&gt;At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal. But then they began to realise how much they were relying on it. The group grew so there were approximately 100 software engineers on my team. Astronauts’ lives were at stake. Our software needed to be ultra-reliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the hardware.\n\n&gt;I thought: my God – this could inadvertently happen in a real mission. I suggested a program change to prevent a prelaunch program being selected during flight. But the higher-ups at MIT and Nasa said the astronauts were too well trained to make such a mistake. Midcourse on the very next mission – Apollo 8 – one of the astronauts on board accidentally did exactly what Lauren had done. The Lauren bug! It created much havoc and required the mission to be reconfigured. After that, they let me put the program change in, all right.\n\n&gt;During the early days of Apollo, software was not taken as seriously as other engineering disciplines. Though in fact we had a complex system of systems, we weren’t getting credit for what was a legitimate field. It was out of desperation I came up with the term, to say: “Hey, we’re engineering too.” It was an ongoing joke for a long time. Then one day in a meeting, one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone that he agreed with me. The process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. It was a memorable moment.\n\n&gt;Also, what became apparent with Apollo – though it is not how it worked – is that it is better to define your system up front to minimise errors, rather than producing a bunch of code that then has to be corrected with patches on patches. It’s a message that seems to have gone unheeded – in this respect, software today is still built the way it was 50 years ago.",

Using this in conjunction with the powerful relational capabilities you know from Datalog, I saw the following applications:\n- Lots of robotics planning. The task in vogue right now seems to be planning the robots that power Amazon’s warehouses, which involves coordinating dozens of agents at once, but ASP handled this very well.\n- Any kind of scheduling tasks. Nurse scheduling, train scheduling.\n- One researcher was using ASP to analyze global-scale internet networks for routing problems (i.e, certain routing configurations could have emergent behavior such that packets never get to their destination, and the researcher was able to encode the problem into ASP).",

        "text": "There are plenty of instances of badly written software putting lives in danger. And true, it was a new field at some point, but what *still* is allowed to pass as \"professional\" software is alarming and embarrassing.\n\nSo that's one of my main points: on the whole, it's like even basic fundamentals of designing coherent software are by and large missing, ignored, or not even grasped. Things like proper decomposition and abstraction, etc.\n\nMy guess is that this is largely due to that fact that you cannot \"see\" what's in a program: the data flows and execution flows, etc. Like many programmers are so used to having to decipher code anyway, that they either don't realize that it doesn't make sense, or that it *can* make straightforward sense.\n\nThere are multiple times in my career where I've thought to myself: if the components and flows and organization in our code was something physical that any non-programmer could walk by and see -- if it was at least vaguely visible what their software \"engineers\" were doing with\/in their software -- the business would be *appalled*. Hey, that's our name on that! We don't have time and money to waste this convoluted nonsense! We expect or customers to *rely* on this stuff!\n\nI know many consider this to be a subjective matter, but I'm not taking about I prefer Jim's style of writing versus Joe's, I'm taking about Sarah laid out the business requirements in two clear paragraphs and a few bullet points, and Sue wrote 5 pages about the same thing with no coherent train of thought. (names and examples are made up).\n\nMy point is that language and tools will not fill this gap, but is something that needs to be understood and fixed in it's own rite.\n\nHOWEVER, I do think it can help tremendously if it's obvious at a glance whether a program (or software component) is straightforward, or horribly convoluted. If we can see what we're doing, maybe we can begin to understand what we're doing, see what we're doing, and talk about it and take ownership of it.\n\n(This is mostly coming from a context of what happens in professional software development, based on my experience and observations)",

        "text": "And the other question is, how do you distill the principles of designing coherent software into something that can easily be explained and taught? I think this is a vital component missing in almost all software education.\n\nI already have some of these figured out, or at least I've been thinking about it and observing it in practice for years. It's somewhat hard to explain without visuals, but essentially it's about making your code match closely with the user mental model, and reducing the gap between code and running program.\n\nSome of it is related to Bret Victor's \"Learnable Programming\" and \"Magic Ink\", but Jim Coplien's work is actually what got me thinking about this stuff to begin with. I recommend watching his \"Reflections on reflection\", as it ties a lot of this together (and draws parallels between Alan Kay, Christopher Alexander, Piaget, etc.): <https:\/\/www.infoq.com\/presentations\/Reflection-OOP-Social\/>",

        "text": "So, I’ve been working on expert systems for two years. The central pitch (of a rules engine) is that it will allow business people to build their rules without programmer involvement. sounds nice, but is not often nice in practice. rule systems can grow very hard to maintain over time. and you maybe need tooling so you can cope with it by detecting overlapping rules or visualize the program flow.\n\nThere is also the question, what skills you need to author and maintain rules. Do people who author rules automatically learn quasi programming skills? Is it maybe better to let (carreer) programmers author the rules, and have business-readable notation instead, to still allow to build a rich and deep communication channel between programmers and business\/underlying domain?\n\nI’ve been reading halfway through “out of the tar pit”, watched half a dozen of lighttable\/eve talks with all the eve experiments, and look into vega dataflow code. I think I’ll work in this area more in the upcoming months.",

        "text": "I think you're ignoring the largest source of problems, the elephant in the room that never gets discussed: incoherence of _ownership_.\n\nSoftware is in a pretty nice state today. Everybody accepts bugs, and unlike other fields we can get away with \"NO WARRANTY\" licenses. So the fundamental problem is one of incentive. As in, giving people an incentive to do better. Right now we can get away with constantly pointing at somebody else when there's a problem. Maybe that will always be true. There are certainly other fields that are sustainably high status relative to their customers. And they tend to involve a priesthood that understands arcane rules. So maybe we can get away with it indefinitely, turning gradually into an ossified field that requires tons of accreditation before you're permitted to write a line of code, and writing code for yourself, well _perish the thought_. Or maybe we create a crisis so vast that the population at large throws their arms up and turns away from the open sea (as happened with <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zheng_He>). This is a personal preference, but I prefer the latter future to the former.\n\nBut really I'd like to avoid both these endgames. And that seems to require _taking responsibility_ for your dependencies. _That_ is the prerequisite. Asking for better representations for your dependencies before you take responsibility is akin to asking for more resources before you can do the work your boss tells you to do. We all know how that conversation goes.",

Coplien's DCI paradigm helped me figure a lot of that out; but I don't think it's necessary at all to use mechanisms like DCI to do it.\n\nBut I'm adamant that you can get most code, regardless of the size and complexity, into a relatively same straightforward form. This is hard to believe, but that's because you can't do it if either your data model or your execution flow model is a mess. Most practices are more one way than the other, but I know how to keep both models sane, and it's always applicable.\n\nGranted, you're not going to get simpler than the complexity of the thing you're designing; but compare how you explain it to a person, to how the code explains it. *That* gap can almost always be greatly reduced.\n\nFailing to do this results in a mess, regardless of language or tool, etc. Though all such things certainly are an important part of the overall puzzle to having coherent software.",

This means the hit target for each input and output is as large as can be given the size of the node and the uniformity of the squares. That makes patching less fiddly than it is in tools with smaller hit targets.\n\nHere's a criticism:\nAll their edges appear to be S-curves. That's fine as a default, but it definitely leaves a huge part of the possibility space unexplored.\n\nWhen evaluating these sorts of VPLs, the devil is in _those_ sorts of details.",
