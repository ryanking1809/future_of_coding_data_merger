        "text": "<@UEQ6M68H0>, Clearly, many recognize such a span as what's necessary for a kind of freedom \/ power that *should* (and could) be possible with computers &amp; software (else it would not be a topic with what \"tends to happen\").\n\nBut also clearly (as you expressed and I agree), that's not achievable with traditional methods. That's why much of that consideration comes from those of us exploring a \"new world\", which challenges \/doesn't take the traditional idea of those things (e.g. \"compiler\") -- or even the entire pipeline itself -- as a given.\n\nI think your statement is a helpful wake-up call to those trying to go floor to ceiling with traditional methods ... and perhaps also evidence that they're what's holding back something better :)",

Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.” ― Richard Buckminster Fuller\n\nTooling and 'way of thinking' are linked (what kind of objects does your tooling operate on and what are the operations? these form the way of thinking.). E.g \"editors *edit* *text files*\" and \"build systems *automate* *program compilation*\" - the last two phrases reveal ways of thinking.\n\nOne corollary is that as long as we're compatible with some tooling, we're implicitly adopting those ways of thinking.\n\nSo whether we\n (a) build little custom tooling and mostly reuse existing tooling; or\n (b) build a lot of custom tooling up front, stay compatible with some existing tooling;\nmight reveal how much of a new way thinking we are adopting. Even (b) adheres to existing ideas to some degree. There might be another option\n (c) replace the existing tooling completely and become incompatible with it.\nMaybe this brings very different ways of thinking. Anyway, that's where my interest lies.\n\n<@UAVCC2X70>’s post about two approaches seems related:\n<https:\/\/github.com\/d-cook\/SomethingNew\/issues\/24#issuecomment-394217045>\n\nAlso I saw this twitter thread put it very nicely as tendencies: 'situated' or 'radical':\n<https:\/\/twitter.com\/flippacpub\/status\/1115287533477355525>",
