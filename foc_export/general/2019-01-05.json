        "text": "We're already in a 'shared virtual world' of sorts. All of the software I run is written by others and open source, and so are open to modification. In reality this world is so fractured and forking\/versioning\/packaging so tedious that it doesn't feel like a shared world at all. How much work is needed just figure out where the 'source code' of an app is, what version I'm running, how to modify it, test it, send a PR or publish a new version and so on? Why is this necessary in a computer capable of creating virtual hypermedia worlds that can be vast and distributed? Ideally the provenance of all software artifacts should be maintained - I should be able to just click on an app, modify it in place and publish my tweaked version, discoverable by my friends and followers.",
