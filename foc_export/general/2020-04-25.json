I have a pretty bad blind spot here, and it's something I want to improve."

We need a clear signal to the outside world that this is something we care about and want to improve. I'm excited to find many ways to send that signal.\n\nWith respect to consultation specifically, there are ways it can backfire — creating additional work for people who are already disadvantaged; implicitly asking individuals to act as representatives of a class. I want to do it, but I don't want to do it badly.\n\nThat's what made me uncomfortable to ask about gender. On one one hand, asking is a signal that it's something we care about and want to learn about. On the other hand, I've seen instances where the very people I'd like to reach are bothered by the tone-deaf way in which others have tried to reach them. To some, a survey question about gender might be seen as interest. To others, it might be seen as a gate.\n\nI like the idea of a diversity survey. I'm going to spin up a conversation about that in <#CEXED56UR|meta>, so if you have thoughts on what that could look like I'd love to have your input.",

We need a clear signal to the outside world that this is something we care about and want to improve. I'm excited to find many ways to send that signal.\n\nWith respect to consultation specifically, there are ways it can backfire — creating additional work for people who are already disadvantaged; implicitly asking individuals to act as representatives of a class. I want to do it, but I don't want to do it badly.\n\nThat's what made me uncomfortable to ask about gender. On one one hand, asking is a signal that it's something we care about and want to learn about. On the other hand, I've seen instances where the very people I'd like to reach are bothered by the tone-deaf way in which others have tried to reach them. To some, a survey question about gender might be seen as interest. To others, it might be seen as a gate.\n\nI like the idea of a diversity survey. I'm going to spin up a conversation about that in "

Sorry!\n\nI'm no more equipped to invite people to this community than anyone else. If there's someone you'd like to see join, invite them! The best thing would be for someone here who already has a relationship with that person to extend an invitation, so if you're looking to make a \"they should be here\" call, then that's the call to make. In this regard, I'm just another bystander."
