        "text": "&gt; So any language that claims to not use mutable state is merely concealing the mapping from pure functions to mutable state.\nAbstraction is the central idea that underlies high level programming languages. There is nothing \"mere\" about it.\n\n&gt;  The inventor of FP, John Backus, had a goal of creating interchangeable parts, and he felt that reducing mutable state would make things more combineable. However, 50 years later his original proposals haven't worked out. There is no evidence that people can take a chunk of Haskell code or any other FP language and inject it into another program easily.\n\n\"no evidence\"? The fact that you can do this is why I fell in love with functional programming, and it's a central part of my mental experience when I am writing functional code. Here's a quote from Backus that you might be referencing:\n&gt; Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose \"unknowns\" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written.\n\nHaskell people call this \"equational reasoning\". It works. It's high school algebra, applied to programs. It's what you do when you think and program in the functional style. In principle, you can use this kind of reasoning when programming in any language. But imperative languages are not designed with equational reasoning in mind: a lot of algebraic laws are just broken and don't work, which makes them frustrating and klunky to use. You are forced to think imperatively, which sucks, although it's a necessary evil when you are doing performance tuning. Functional languages are specifically designed to have a large set of algebraic laws, which makes them much more satisfying to use if you think this way when you program.",

Thank you.\n\nMy point with 1) was just that if you minimize your 'global' store, and keep many smaller contained, local stores the problems you outline can be mitigated. I was asking if you agree. (This pattern is now being encouraged in React also: Context plus many useReducers)\n\nThe dictionary vs essay metaphor is interesting. Thanks.\n\nRe: visualizations. I recently saw that other talk you gave on this with the different visualizations of the temperature converter. This makes more sense now. You see possibilities for many types of visualizations here.\n\nI've opened a few issues on Turbine about the documentation, or fixing up some of the examples. I saw you opened some issues complaining about the docs, and I hope to carry on in that tradition. Turbine is definitely intrinsically interesting enough to me, but it would be cool also to see it develop further.\n\nAlthough you dropped the FRP-viz work, are you still an FRP-believer, as it were? Is there other stuff here besides Turbine that one should keep their eye on? You've brought this OG FRP stuff to my attention, but now I'm disappointed I don't see more of it around!",

        "text": "The \"functional mindset\" (equational reasoning) and the \"imperative mindset\" are two quite different ways of thinking when you are programming. Perhaps this claim that shared mutable state is \"natural\" and \"corresponds to the real world\" is really just a way of saying that you are more comfortable thinking in the imperative mindset. Over on the <#CKC6FM9DF|category-theory> channel, we are learning category theory, which is the mathematical structure that underlies a lot of the algebraic laws and equational reasoning in Haskell. A relevant quote from a recent post: \"It turns out that many of the ideas of category theory come almost directly from the real world.\" Sounds familiar. That quote resonates with me, because at this point, I feel more comfortable with equational reasoning for most programming tasks, and my intuition tells me that the basic algebraic laws that functional programs obey also apply in a lot of real world situations outside of programming. For example, in math, addition is commutative and associative, which means that the order in which I count a set of objects (eg, the socks in my sock drawer) doesn't affect the answer. In a pure functional language, addition is also commutative and associative (modulo floating point roundoff errors), but once you add shared mutable state to a language, then these properties are lost: f(x)+g(x) is no longer equivalent to g(x)+f(x) because the order in which you call the functions now matters and can affect the result.",

But some statements activate my overhype-ometer (e.g. \"We incorporate these into a formally verified functional programming approach, which allows us to provide unprecedented correctness guarantees.\")\n\nThis talk argues that total languages (~guaranteed to terminate) don't particularly help verification (link to section about total languages): <https:\/\/youtu.be\/dWdy_AngDp0?t=1273>.

        "text": "&gt; mutable state is (repeating a cliche at this point) a fact of life and there are different options for dealing with it\n\nAgreed. \"Shared mutable state\" (SMS) is only one of the options for dealing with mutable state. SMS is strongly associated with OOP. You put all of your mutable state into objects, and the objects are organized into a graph, which usually contains cycles. That graph of object references makes shared mutable state unavoidable. An interesting alternative to OOP is data-oriented design (DOD). In this paradigm, you put all of your data into a centralized hierarchical data structure, analogous to a relational database. Application logic is kept separate from the data. DOD seems to be associated with systems level programming in C++ and Rust; the video game version is called Entity Component Systems.\n\nThe claimed benefits of DOD are performance (better cache coherence, better multi-core performance) and maintainability (it's easier to evolve the code in response to changing requirements: you aren't constantly refactoring a class hierarchy). Some DOD practitioners are also claiming smaller code size, which is great if you are compiling to WASM. It's better for Rust programming, because cyclic object graphs in OOP \"break the borrow checker\", plus Rustacians are interested in performance and maintainability.\n\nI'm still trying to get a handle on DOD. Because of that central hierarchical data structure, it doesn't seem to require shared mutable state, and it seems compatible with pure functional programming. It also looks more compatible with GPU programming, because OOP object graphs aren't feasible on a GPU. So I'm investigating these ideas in the context of my Curv project, which can be considered a pure functional language for programming GPUs. A while back, somebody posted a reference to Raph Levian's Druid, a data oriented GUI framework in Rust. There is also Elm, which is a pure functional language for creating GUIs. The Elm Architecture seems to have some resemblance to DOD.",

Philosophically you can say either one.. maybe it's a different house every moment as those atoms travel through time. But conceptually it can be considered the \"same house\" even when you actually modify it, rebuild a wall, etc. It's the human mental model of the world that maintains the concept of identity.",
