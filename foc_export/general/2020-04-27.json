I think that's plenty good enough reason to do it.\n\n<@UCKRZS3DZ> — You're generalizing, and sensationalizing, which makes it hard to respond to you constructively.\n\nArguing against our diversity initiatives _in this thread_ is not welcome, because I started the thread to talk about the podcast and survey, and I asked for folks to take the diversity discussion back to <#CEXED56UR|meta>. It didn't happen. It just sucks that it looks like we don't get to have a discussion about the survey now. There are a ton of other interesting things we could learn from it.\n\nI have elsewhere said something to the effect of.. further objection to the diversity initiatives is not welcome. That was a mistake on my part. Of course people need to be able to say, \"Hey, this particular diversity initiative is not a good idea. I have suggestions for how we could do something better.\" And while I don't like it, it's not against any rules to say, \"I don't think we should do diversity initiatives at all, because [for example] they'll drain resources from other initiatives, and I think that there's going to be a bigger problem if that happens.\" What I should have said is: There are a lot of people who are unhappy about the composition and tenor of the community, and it would be very hurtful to say that we shouldn't at least try to help them, so I will kindly ask that you not do that openly.\n\n<@UKASUGYL8> and <@UCKRZS3DZ> — I didn't delete your comments because of politics. Please stop simply labeling things as \"left-wing\" and instead explain what you mean by it. The term \"left-wing\" is too vague and open to interpretation because of how many different ways its used in the broader world, so if you want to make your arguments carry weight, you should instead use your own words. You're also stating that things are left-wing as though that's inherently a reason to not do those things. If that's a point that you intend to make, you'll need to explain why that is.\n\nSo again, it's not about politics for me — I deleted Vladimir's comment because, after reflecting on it for _hours_ and in my judgment as community moderator, I felt it was sexist in a way that'd cause harm. And since I was going to delete that comment, I decided to remove the other comments that had moved this thread in a hostile direction. Achraf, you characterized our interest in diversity as an _infection_. That's not against the rules, but it's absolutely mean spirited. Jack's comments were not mean spirited, so they remain.",

This question, \"What FoC topics interest you most?\" was my attempt at it, and it was a bit of a disaster!\n\nI think it would be exhausting to list _all_ our possible interests, but grouping some them together also seems to have caused issues. The more we lean on the fill-in answers, the less we'll be able to identify shared interests because the way we describe them will be different. If we let people select as many answers as they want, we'll have a harder time visualizing the result set because we have to decide how to weight each selection. But if we limit the number of selections, Duncan gets really mad, and (sigh) rightfully so.\n\nI hope it's clear what I was interested in learning from this, but I think I bungled the execution. It'd be super interesting to hear how _you_ would go able trying to structure this question. How would you build a survey that attempted to figure out what our most _central_ interests were, and to what degree we were interested in those things? The things to maximize are: how much can we learn, and how efficiently and painlessly can we collect that data from people?",
