        "text": "&gt; My point with 1) was just that if you minimize your 'global' store, and keep many smaller contained, local stores the problems you outline can be mitigated. I was asking if you agree. (This pattern is now being encouraged in React also: Context plus many useReducers)\n\nPossibly, but I don't think so. My gut says that we should only lump together that data which **must** be lumped together because pieces are dependent on each other. Any time we put data in the same store for convenience, we create a grouping where one doesn't need to exist.\n\nBut my intuition on this is developing. I read a really great post recently that pushed forward my understanding on what I'm trying to get at here: <https:\/\/blog.statebox.org\/modularity-vs-compositionality-a-history-of-misunderstandings-be0150033568>. I'm also going through the _category theory for programmers_ course with  <#CKC6FM9DF|category-theory> which is really helping me get clearer on what I mean by compositionality. One key point: the IO Monad, while technically composible, isn't meaningfully composible because it doesn't have simple or precise semantics. Other monads are better at this, but if you use a monad to create global state, you're back to imperitive programming...\n\n&gt;  are you still an FRP-believer, as it were?\n\nGlad you're pushing the Turbine guys still! Yes I'm a huge believer in FRP. At this point it seems so obviously right to me, but it still needs to be extended. I spent a little while in the past weeks brainstorming what an distributed, mixed-ownership FRP operating system for all our devices could look like. (You can find scattered notes on <http:\/\/futureofcoding.org\/log|futureofcoding.org\/log> but I wouldn't recommend it.)\n\n&gt;  Is there other stuff here besides Turbine that one should keep their eye on?\n\nI'm still trying to make sense of Conal's work. So you can always spend more time there. And <#CKC6FM9DF|category-theory> if you haven't already. Seems almost like required reading for people looking to push the OG FRP paradigm",

Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or calculus ratiocinator.\nThe characteristica universalis is a recurring concept in the writings of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase spécieuse générale to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a calculus ratiocinator and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge.",

On immutable world you have no constraint so in it's completely ok to convert between types with modifications. Or should you use hashmap or list of tuples? Effectively those are same if we ignore duplicate keys (and ordering) but we can take those details into account with functions that we use. For example we would have separated functions for list of tupel\/hashmap: AddAndKeepDuplicate and AddIfNotExist. If you use latter one hashmap implementation can be used at runtime etc.Sometimes it's nice to know that structure is strictly stack but when doing traditional business glue code in F# I have noticed that there is quite a lot trivial conversions.\nSo what it would look like if we would keep *detailed knowledge how to do X* in a functions itself instead of data structure?",

You should all know that Leibniz (1646-1716), as in the other originator of calculus and the d\/dx notation, toyed with the idea of a language, a symbol system in which geometric composition of the symbols would correspond in some natural way to inference.  At thirty, it thought the project could be completed in five years.\n\nAt 60, he still liked the idea, though imagined more investigators would be necessary, \"It is true that in the past I planned a new way of calculating suitable for matters which have nothing in common with mathematics [\"mathematics\" seems to have been defined more narrowly 300 years ago], and if this kind of logic were put into practice, every reasoning, even probabilistic ones, would be like that of the mathematician: if need be, the lesser minds which had application and good will could, if not accompany the greatest minds, then at least follow them. For one could always say: let us calculate, and judge correctly through this, as much as the data and reason can provide us with the means for it. But I do not know if I will ever be in a position to carry out such a project, which requires more than one hand; and it even seems that mankind is still not mature enough to lay claim to the advantages which this method could provide.\"\n\nBy 70, he lamented, \"I have spoken to the Marquis de l'Hôpital and others about my general algebra, but they have paid no more attention to it than if I had told them about a dream of mine. I should have to support it too by some obvious application, but to achieve this it would be necessary to work out at least a part of my characteristic, a task which is not easy, especially in my present condition and without the advantage of discussions with men who could stimulate and help me in work of this nature.\"\n\nCould have used a friendly Slack.",
