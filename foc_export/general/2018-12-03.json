        "text": "Thanks <@UDJ2TKB99>, the Widdows et al. link is very interesting, and makes a good stab at one of the most difficult problems, of building ontologies retroactively which previously I'd only seen tackled by \"Semprola\", Oli Sharpe's system which I mentioned in the other thread. I'd like to get some more technical detail on how the \"roles\" system is implemented and interpreted in practice, and perhaps even some source code : P The \"noms\" project seems to concentrate on the less interesting part of the problem, that is, how can we assure the integrity and availability of the data, the problem subset that we see tackled, for example, in the current incarnation of the \"Dat\" project - <https:\/\/datproject.org\/> . It's great that our case studies also focus on visualizing wildlife sightings, got a few links to those followup papers?",

        "text": "Thanks for the kind words on the paper, <@UCUSW7WVD> - indeed as you suggest, a program addition operator for arbitrary code is not workable, under the \"black box\" model. This is why we propose the abolition of program code as currently constituted - you can check out the parallel paper at <https:\/\/github.com\/amb26\/papers\/raw\/master\/onward-2016\/onward-2016.pdf> on the \"Open Authorial Principle\" for positive and negative constraints on how this replacement for code will need to be organised. Indeed it must operate on the \"white box\" principles you suggest - also note section 5.4 which explains that our program algebra is not like others which have been proposed, in being primarily decompositional rather than compositional. The OAP I think offers helpful economics and models of how the adopting community can \"mess with the guts\" of adopted artefacts whilst i) maintaining a relationship with the upstream community, ii) not necessarily disrupting the upstream community's artefacts.\nIndeed comprehensibility is a key virtue underpinning all authorial activities, an important prerequisite of which is visibility\/addressibility.\nI should stop saying \"indeed\" but my 2-yr-old son has recently adopted it as an idiom from his favorite TV character, Flop.",
