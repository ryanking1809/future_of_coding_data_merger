        "text": "Here’s my cognitive-science-hobbyist theory of what’s the problem with node-link languages:\n\nNode-link makes effective use of the link image schema (<https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image_schema|https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image_schema>). Such schemas are universal patterns that structure our thinking on the lowest levels. These patterns also provide the infrastructure for spoken and written language as well, so they sit both under visual and text-based languages. (If “sitting under” makes sense to you in that previous sentence, that’s because it’s an example for a spatial metaphor build on top of image schemas.)\n\nNode-link languages work well, because they hook into that particular link pattern which we all intuitively understand. That’s where their power comes from. Unfortunately, one pattern isn’t enough to model everything. However, it’s great when it’s almost all you need in the domain you are modeling for.\n\nSome node-link languages add a second image schema by allowing containment. The container schema is also why files and folders and directory structures are so pervasive. That’s a little more expressive, but two patterns are still not enough to model all the complex things general programming languages can.\n\nWhere node-link languages break down is: they usually offer no solution to the problem of anchoring things to locations. It usually doesn’t matter where you put nodes on an often infinite canvas. Location has no meaning, like it does in a map, or a scatter plot, where each dot is precisely tied to a location. \n\nWhile placing things arbitrarily on a canvas sounds positive like flexibility and freedom, it creates cognitive effort because we will quickly feel overwhelmed placing large number of objects in a space without any supporting structure. So we invent that structure on the fly, trying something like ordering nodes by data flow, which works well enough for when you’re just modeling how data flows through a number of filters and transformers. But often we end up with conflicting structures. That’s when we start talking about how it all looks like spaghettis.\n\nFor some reason media apps are good at taking advantage of image schemas and metaphorical structuring, which I believe is all happy accidents simply because these patterns are how we think and when designing UI we gravitate towards them even if we don’t know why. \n\nThink waveform visualizations in audio recording software or MIDI notes. X-axis is often bound to time giving position meaning — the same reason why charts and diagrams are often easier to grasp: image schemas giving rise to powerful spatial metaphors.\n\nThat media apps seem to discover these schemas is less of a coincidence and connected to how we understand media as events spread across time (yep, guess what’s the basis for that…). In general programming we think much more abstract and have many completely incompatible orderings at the same time, e.g. data flow with concurrency, static type hierarchies, hierarchical stack frames, sequential memory — it’s easy to visualize each one of them at a time, but it’s essentially just different views on the same system.\n\nI firmly believe that we can deliberately take advantage of this particular knowledge in cognitive science in UI design and ultimately for designing better “visual” languages. If you see any research that’s combining these fields, please send it my way. And if you want to learn more about the cognitive science parts feel free to contact me. I’m happy to provide plenty of pointers to resources I can recommend.",

                "text": "An image schema is a recurring structure within our cognitive processes which establishes patterns of understanding and reasoning. Image schemas are formed from our bodily interactions, from linguistic experience, and from historical context. The term is explained in Mark Johnson's book The Body in the Mind; in case study 2 of George Lakoff's Women, Fire and Dangerous Things; by Rudolf Arnheim in Visual Thinking; and more recently, by Tim Rohrer's 2006 book chapter \"Image Schemata in the Brain\".\nIn contemporary cognitive linguistics, an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates conceptual metaphor mappings. Evidence for image schemas (also called image schemata) is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in psychology, from spatial cognition in both linguistics and psychology, cognitive linguistics, and from neuroscience.",
