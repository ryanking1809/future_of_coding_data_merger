        "text": "Paul, I recently read this book and it is totally awesome imho. I agree with your thought and on my opinion we see the trend of more and more tools for power users (the author introduced 3 levels like users, power users\/creators, programmers). I envision we will have more such tools in all domains and niches.\n\nI also think DSL is close to expert domain vocabulary and is much easier to learn that any general purpose programming language.\n\nWhy Eve and HyperCard failed (in a way)? They were too general and lacked focus. HyperCard demanded real programming (and Eve as well).",

        "text": "<@UE6EFEPTQ> Yes, I think declarative languages are inherently less complex than imperative languages. I think in this case the declarative nature of the sum is not the only reason why it is more approachable say for an accountant as an example. If you contrast the spreadsheet SUM function with a simple map function. Both are declarative but SUM is a concept that’s familiar to the accountant while map is a foreign concept that is unnecessarily generic if all the accountant wants to do is calculating SUMS and a handful of other statistical functions.\n\nEdit: saw your second comment fold is probably a better example",

Later when I realized it might lead to dead-end code which I am unable the refactor I dumped this. I started to overcomplicate code as an anti-thesis.\n3. Later, I recognised features\/ideas die, so I will have to get rid of some parts of my code no matter what. The “synthesis” is trying to write as little code as possible and focus, cutting and getting rid of (“overlapping”) features as much as possible. (I also realized writing code which is easy to change is a feature itself!)\nHowever as focusing on that I tend to write “hackier” code again, at least I am always questioning myself why I don’t just keep it simple instead going too abstract - is it really worth it? But being “simple” also adds a quite hard limit what I can or can’t do. This is what leads me again to be “(mutable-)hacky”, which extends the possibilites on that “hard limit” - so what I try to do is push “standalone” hacky solutions into Units so the whole system might just be ok.\n\nI suspect this “valueable hackyness” has to do something with “identity” \/ “problems naturally expressed with mutability”. With preserved identity and mutability it is OFTEN MUCH EASIER to add some “clever” code to add a *limited* set features. Even the Unit tests are simpler and the code has smaller “surface” to test.\n\nI am aware things can blow off any time that way, but the conclusion I have today is its easier to rewrite “easy” parts than going accidentally too abstract (which is kind of having the wrong abstractions for the domain which is a kind of technical debt itself).\n\nI am curious what do you think about the relation of simplicity, “clever\/hacky” solutions, mutability, identity, FP. - Is it something you also feel? Do you feel similar pressure?",
