Should be super easy to drop a rich comment for particular piece of code, or reference it somewhere.\n2) Versioning of the code. Must be a way to keep old versions of code, reference them.\n3) Explicit dependencies stored alongside. If I open old version of code, I should get references to all dependencies of that time, and it should work.\n4) Ability to see where particular functions were called.\n5) Easy collaboration, sharing of code.\n\nI want this platform to be able to offer several interfaces for the same code (might be visual or just old plain text).\nThe interface code should be part of this platform lying next to actual code.\n\nI've just read this tweet <https:\/\/twitter.com\/chatur_shalabh\/status\/1035599115793526784>,\nAnd got feeling that probably <@U8A5MS6R1> may have exactly same thoughts about all of this.\n\nThen I've listened to Ted Nelson's ideas about hypermedia and links that visible on both ends.\nThen I've also read <@U8A5MS6R1> article about files: <https:\/\/shalabh.com\/programmable-systems\/files-and-file-formats.html>\n\nSo it seems like in the end I'm not looking for specific code platform.\nIt seems like I'm looking for more advanced hypermedia than today's web,\nthat can store code along with other content.\n\nI'm not sure yet how exactly on this platform code gonna be stored, and what kind of programming languages would execute it.\nI'm just designing it rich enough that it would be possible.\n\n----------------------\n\nThe idea is following: we create a graph where all data is stored as nodes and edges.\nNodes and edges are immutable, and thus graph has many properties that git has.\n\nUser may replicate to his machine any set of nodes he interested in from other peers.\nUser may create node or edge between any two nodes on his machine.\nEach node and edge is signed by an author.\n\nNodes are addressed by their content, just like it is with magnet links (DHT).\nUser may search for edges for this particular node on peers machines.\n\nThis looks really powerful, yet not that complicated.\nCertainly someone else already thought about it.",

                "text": "A structure editor, also structured editor or projectional editor, is any document editor that is cognizant of the document’s underlying structure. Structure editors can be used to edit hierarchical or marked up text, computer programs, diagrams, chemical formulas, and any other type of content with clear and well-defined structure.  In contrast, a text editor is any document editor used for editing plain text files.Typically, the benefits of text and structure editing are combined in the user interface of a single hybrid tool.  For example, Emacs is fundamentally a text editor, but supports the manipulation of words, sentences, and paragraphs as structures that are inferred from the text.  Conversely, Dreamweaver is fundamentally a structure editor for marked up web documents, but supports the display and manipulation of raw HTML text as well.  Similarly, molecule editors typically support both graphical and textual input. Structure editing predominates when content is graphical and textual representations are awkward, e.g., CAD systems and PowerPoint.  Text editing predominates when content is largely devoid of structure, e.g., text fields in web forms.  WYSIWYG word processing systems such as Word, which appear to edit formatted text directly, are essentially structure editors for the underlying marked-up text.\nIn linguistics, syntax is the study of the structure of grammatical utterances, and accordingly syntax-directed editor is a synonym for structure editor.  Language-based editor and language-sensitive editor are also synonyms. A language-based editor’s features may be implemented by ad hoc code or by a formal grammar.  For example, language sensitivity in Emacs is implemented in the Lisp definition of the edit mode for the given language.  In contrast, language sensitivity in an XML editor is driven by a formal DTD schema for the given language.\nAlthough structured editors allow the viewing and manipulation of the underlying document in a structured manner, the file format in which the document is stored on disk may or may not be heavily structured and may or may not be open or standardized (e.g., plain text versus Microsoft Word documents).\n\nStructure editing has often been employed in source code editors, as source code is naturally structured by the syntax of the computer language. However, most source code editors are instead text editors with additional features such as syntax highlighting and code folding, rather than structure editors. The editors in some integrated development environments parse the source code and generate a parse tree, allowing the same analysis as by a structure editor, but the actual editing of the source code is generally done as raw text.\nEach programming language typically has a well-defined syntax given by a context-free grammar, and accordingly the meaningful structural elements in source code written in the language correspond to the grammatical phrases in the text.  Early syntax-directed source code editors included Interlisp-D (for Lisp’s limited syntax) and Emily (for PL\/I’s rich syntax).\nA syntax-directed editor may treat grammar rules as generative (e.g., offering the user templates that correspond to one or more steps in a formal derivation of program text) or proscriptive (e.g., preventing a phrase of a given part of speech from being moved to a context where another part of speech is required) or analytic (e.g., parsing textual edits to create a structured representation).  Structure editing features in source code editors make it harder to write programs with invalid syntax.  Language-sensitive editors may impose syntactic correctness as an absolute requirement (e.g., as did Mentor), or may tolerate syntax errors after issuing a warning (e.g., as did the Cornell Program Synthesizer).  Strict structured editors often make it difficult to perform edits that are easy to perform with plain text editors, which is one of the factors contributing to the lack of adoption of structured editing in some domains, such as source code editing.\nSome syntax-directed editors monitor compliance with the context-sensitive constraints of a language such as type correctness.  Such static-semantic constraints may be specified imperatively by actions (e.g., as in Gandalf), or declaratively by an attribute grammar (e.g., as in the Synthesizer Generator) or by unification in a many-sorted algebra (e.g., as in PSG ) or a logic program (e.g., as in Centaur and Pan), with compliance checked by the underlying editing machinery.  Structured editors vary in the degree to which they allow their users to perform edits that cause the document to become syntactically or semantically incorrect.\nIt is common for a language sensitive editor to represent a document as a parse tree with respect to language’s grammar, or as an abstract syntax tree (AST).  For example, a DOM tree is essentially an AST with respect to a given DTD.  Frequently, the textual view of that underlying tree is generated by prettyprinting the underlying tree.  Editors associated with intentional programming and language-oriented programming for general-purpose languages and domain-specific languages share many of the features of language-sensitive editors, but aim for greater separation between the underlying representation (the intention) and the surface representation (text in a programming language).",

It should be part of one node.\n\nSo different kinds of data, probably for different applications should be stored in one node.\nI came up with idea of having namespaces, where application author's public key serves as namespace for node attribute.",

        "text": "Thanks for reading my blog, <@UCKRZS3DZ> :smile:. I'm still trying to think these things through. My belief is that we need to think about this from a holistic, whole-system perspective and rethink whether the prevalent concepts are even necessary.\n\nI like the ideas you are proposing and I'll add some of my thoughts below. This is absolutely about a new and different kind of hypermedia, and *not* a replication of physical paper in a digital machine (which is what text files are). I do think a *single* location-independent, append-only graph like system could be used to hold *all* static structural things - code (if we need it), rich media, and all their interconnections, sub parts and versions.\n\nAll replication can be orthogonal - whether its for caching a part of this graph to a user's local machine or for redundancy. We can have just a single namespace that can precisely point to any object in this world. Alan Kay once said something like 'give every object a URL'.\n\nThen we can think about built-in concepts, i.e metadata that this system supports. Something like 'new version' is just a special kind of edge. So is 'derived from' (e.g. I use a tool to convert a picture to grayscale, the new picture should be linked to the old, and to the function\/tool that modified it). Even 'type-of' could be an edge that links a media object to a transcoder object - you shouldn't have to go hunting around for 'programs' that will decode a 'file' you have. Any dynamic\/executable objects should link to *all* objects that form the interpreters\/runtimes\/dependencies that it needs - no more runarounds trying to recreate the environment from reading READMEs or whatever. IOW, preserve the connection to the *context*.\n\nOptimizations and compromises (such as discarding edges) should be defined separately, rather than designed in (we want a system that is limited by computer constraints only, not by design).\n\nI also think it is important not to build in assumptions like programming paradigms etc, so many kinds can be supported. Of course, much of the work is in the details.\n\nBTW, some related ideas are in the <http:\/\/unisonweb.org|unisonweb.org> and in <http:\/\/infra-structure.org|infra-structure.org>.",

        "text": ":thumbsup: Yes - files are 'in the way'. First we break apart our interconnected structures into different files and then invent ways to put them back together. I also agree persistence should be 'orthogonal' to structure. Files cause another  conflation here as they are also the unit of persistence. We have to do all kinds of gymnastics to use files consistently (databases, version control etc.). Interestingly, the B-trees are often bound both below and above the file (i.e. in filesystems implementations and database implementations). It seems like a 'system smell' that these definitions cannot collapse into one.\n\nMaybe the general idea here is that any 'partition' of some 'whole' (e.g. files) can be problematic. But partitioning is also useful because we do want to break apart the whole into smaller bits... so there's a tension there. Even 'programs' are a partitioning concept - a system is broken down into programs, and the behavior is the result of coupling between programs and shared libraries, configuration etc.. it all seems very messy.\n\nIn another thread started by <@UCKRZS3DZ> we're discussing something related - a distributed, append-only graph to store 'everything'.\n\nCould you elaborate on what you mean by hash identified tuples\/lists?",

        "text": "It sounds like we’re searching for the “atoms of data”. What is the smallest entity to model data structures?\n\nWe already know that we can represent anything as a stream of bytes. That seems to be a universal format, but that alone isn’t enough. A stream of bytes is only usable with some sort of encoding. That is usually not explicitly part of the data itself, but external, e.g. when we implicitly assume that a stream of bytes is UTF-8 encoded.\n\nNow that gives us a text string. Which is still pretty universal, but not enough to do anything interesting with it. We want to express structure, because structure gives us a way to have proper entities. Entities allow us to do meaningful computation with them.\n\nSo we invented all kinds of ways to break a text string down into entities. That’s where it diverges into a hell of a lot of different formats we invented over time. Simple Unix configuration and data files with various formats, often using one or two different delimiters (often newlines and spaces or tabs) to break strings into entities.\nThese give us simple collections to do some meaningful computation with.\n\nBut that’s still not enough, because we also need hierarchy, or nesting, and so we invented more elaborate ways to encode that, e.g. XML or JSON.\nThese give us trees and as such even more interesting ways to compute with them.\n\nSomewhere along this way, we made some decisions that got us where we are today — so it’s not exactly terrible, but at least most of us here think we can do better.\n\nI think it’s relatively easy to see why a graph looks so appealing to us. But I think the core question is not “Should it be a graph?” but rather “What exactly do the nodes and edges represent?”",
