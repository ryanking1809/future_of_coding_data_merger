In fact, at a lower level a causal tree is just a sequence of events. Each event is uniquely identified by its author (read device\/editor unique id) and a timestamp in that author's timeline. A revision is identified by the last event for each author involved in the revision. With this you identify the sequence of events for this revision and you are able to consistently reconstruct the state from it.",

If you are aware of new \"older events\" later (it is weird to write this :slightly_smiling_face: ), they are not included in the revision tag T1. If you want to consider them you need to create a new tag T2. As an offline first system, you could never know what happens concurently, and you can only identify version on events you have heard about. So all this allow to identify versions without ambiguity, considering the full and complete history of the events log, with such a tag you can reconstruct a \"past\" state. But of course it says nothing on the meaning of a particular tag, i.e. there is no meaning in it for stuff like \"this is the stable version at the moment\" (as you mentionned).",

And in particular, where Steve has been, the connections he has \/ has had, the following here, his involvement with education, etc. ... It seems that Steve is very much at a center-point of all this (at least from a community\/influence standpoint), and in the very fortunate position to have been where he's been and connect and that he's able to be formally researching and developing this stuff as the main focus of his time ... I don't know that there's anyone else on the planet quite in that position of ability and center of influence.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that it's my opinion that the best thing anyone can do for this collaborative effort \/ future of coding, is to enhance Steve's work &amp; influence as much as possible, and also of this community.\n\nThat's not to say don't work on your own stuff -- we need as many people doing that as possible! But as far as growing and empowering a community and an individual in a unique position to drive it forward -- whether personally or though his connections and influence -- I think there's enormous potential to focus\/draw as much as possible to him &amp; this community. If we help Steve succeed, we help this community &amp; effort succeed.\n\nIt seems that perhaps Alan Kay felt the same way, yes?\n\nSo for example, rather than doing any further work to build up my own community from nothing, I would just direct people here. And anything we as a community can do to get Steve as much funding and sources and contacts\/followers as possible, could have tremendous potential \/ payoff for the future of software. Seriously, he's in a very privileged position (and lucky to have some key influences &amp; friends that helped him get there).\n\nJust saying, think about it",

The idea is to search through a collection of source files for code fragments relating to a scenario, and put all of those fragments into a single file. Each fragment is tagged with location data (file name\/line number). Then you read and edit the fragment file. Then you run the reverse transformation, which writes the modified fragments back into the original source files. No GUI is necessary, so it's easy to implement (mine is 83 lines of code). This is a CLI tool, and the CLI is the original extensible IDE. I'd use a graphical IDE if it was as easy to extend as the CLI. (Maybe there's an IDE that is as malleable as the CLI? Thanks to this list, I now know about Glamorous Toolkit, but I haven't tried it yet. It probably doesn't help me because I can't use Smalltalk for my programming.)",
