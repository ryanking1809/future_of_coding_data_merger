When I switched from BASIC to C (an “industrial tool”) I programmed in C stuff that I could have had used BASIC for with more ease. Part of it is to learn the industrial tool, and part of it is because I’d rather even forget the limited tool if it may reduce my cognitive load which is already burdened with an abundance of stuff",

            "text": "Okay folks, i just spent the weekend coding a version of little kid's Lumberjack game that was programmed in React\/Typescript (playable game at <https:\/\/lumber-jack.netlify.com\/>).  I did a high-fidelity clone of the React version in my Beads language, and published the results.  The Beads version is here on GitHub (<https:\/\/github.com\/magicmouse\/beads-examples\/tree\/master\/Example%20-%20Lumberjack>).  Although the source code is comparable, the reduçtion in the number of source files from 13 to 1 is favorable, and the reduction of external API's referenced directly or indirectly from 1300 to 13 is 100:1 reduction in terms of dependencies. A big part of the problem with programming especially in the JS world is the horrible tangled web of interdependencies, which makes interchangeable parts impossible in the JS\/framework space IMHO.\n\nIf you have your own favorite language, why not try making the game yourself, the original React version has all the art and sound effect assets you would need already created. And if there are any lurkers on this group that would like to try Beads out please message me.",

In the original Win32 programming days, when Simonyi's \"hungarian notation\" was the rage in the windows programming world, one would prefix with one or 2 letters to hint at the data type. But nowadays with strongly typed languages, having to repeat the data type over and over is a clumsy approach. Some languages are taking the approach of trying to infer the type from the usage, but there's nothing wrong with having the user declare the type somewhere at the top.",
