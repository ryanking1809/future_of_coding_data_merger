It will cover a niche that most of those languages don't though, in that I think it will have language level support for low level patterns that game developers already use but can be painful to implement in a disciplined way in C++ or C#.  Something that isn't a goal of Rust.  I actually think Jai encodes John's knowledge of how \"game programming should be\" from the last 30 years of game development on the scale he's done it at though, and doesn't really solve problems for modern games developers, let alone Future.  So it's not really the \"Future of Coding\" for games, but more like the past.",
