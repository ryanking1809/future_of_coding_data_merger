        "text": "<@UEQ6M68H0> I believe that pinning down a language just doesn't work. Programming languages constantly change and traditional SW dev strategies like Waterfall don't work because you just can't build things perfectly on the first try. We should make changing our PLs as easy as possible to allow improvements to be made. Our choice of the \"source of truth\" representation (that's used for storing programs) has a big impact on how easy our PL can be evolved. Different representations (separation of concerns) allow breaking changes in one representation (e.g. removing syntactic sugar in the user-facing syntax) without breaking other layers (e.g. the storage representation).",
