We didn't have the install disks (bought the Mac used with a 20MB HD which just randomly happened to have HC on it), so after a while, my sister and I had totally vandalized the hell out of those stacks and there was no going back.\n\nI count myself among the people for whom HC was the gateway into programming.. though I was also playing with Logo at the same time, so \/shrug\/",

There is a gaping hole in the space of computing, and each of us should feel it deeply. As we go about our daily use of technology, each of us might recognise the need for not-yet-created small tools and applications. But because these are not the kind of things that would be showered with venture funding or become the next Facebook, no one will create them for us. They could help us do our jobs better or make our lives easier or more delightful – imagine being able to build the simple note-taking app you’ve always wanted – but because they are hard for non-programmers to create, we find ourselves forced to dismiss these desires as not available to us. But it needn’t be this way.",
